# NOTE(wesm): When updating the build, please remember also to update the
# pinned Arrow version. We are letting parquet-cpp build its own Apache Arrow
# so that we do not have to update conda-packages for Arrow before we can
# update this package. So if there is an ABI change in Arrow, we can update
# this package faster
