/// Represents Arrow Features that might not have full support

/// two scenarios:
///  1.  A mechanism for readers of Arrow Streams
///      and files to understand that the stream or file makes
///      use of a feature that isn't supported or unknown to
///      the implementation (and therefore can meet the Arrow
///      forward compatibility guarantees).
///  2.  A means of negotiating between a client and server
///      what features a stream is allowed to use. The enums
///      values here are intented to represent higher level
///      features, additional details maybe negotiated
///      with key-value pairs specific to the protocol.
///
/// Enums added to this list should be assigned power-of-two values
/// to facilitate exchanging and comparing bitmaps for supported
/// features.
