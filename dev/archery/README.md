# Developing with Archery

Archery is documented on the Arrow website:

* [Daily development using Archery](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/continuous_integration/archery.html)
* [Using Archery and Crossbow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/continuous_integration/crossbow.html)
* [Using Archery and Docker](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/continuous_integration/docker.html)

# Installing Archery

See the pages linked above for more details. As a general overview, Archery
comes in a number of subpackages, each needing to be installed if you want
to use the functionality of it:

* lint – lint (and in some cases auto-format) code in the Arrow repo
  To install: `pip install -e "arrow/dev/archery[lint]"`
* benchmark – to run Arrow benchmarks using Archery
  To install: `pip install -e "arrow/dev/archery[benchmark]"`
* docker – to run docker-compose based tasks more easily
  To install: `pip install -e "arrow/dev/archery[docker]"`
* release – release related helpers
  To install: `pip install -e "arrow/dev/archery[release]"`
* crossbow – to trigger + interact with the crossbow build system
  To install: `pip install -e "arrow/dev/archery[crossbow]"`
* crossbow-upload
  To install: `pip install -e "arrow/dev/archery[crossbow-upload]"`

Additionally, if you would prefer to install everything at once,
`pip install -e "arrow/dev/archery[all]"` is an alias for all of
the above subpackages.

For some prior art on benchmarking in Arrow, see [this prototype](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/0409498819332fc479f8df38babe3426d707fb9e/dev/benchmarking).
