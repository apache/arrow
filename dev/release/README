requirements:
- being a committer to be able to push to dist and maven repository
- a gpg key to sign the artifacts
- use java 7. check your JAVA_HOME environment variable (at least for now. See ARROW-930) 
- have the build requirements for cpp and c_glibg installed (see their README)

to release, run the following (replace 0.1.0 with version to release):

#create a release branch
git co -b release-0_1_0
#setup gpg agent for signing artifacts
source dev/release/setup-gpg-agent.sh

# prepare release v 0.1.0 (run tests, sign artifacts). Next version will be 0.1.1-SNAPSHOT, RC 0
sh dev/release/00-prepare.sh 0.1.0 0.1.1 0
# push the tag
git push apache apache-arrow-0.1.0-rc0
# tag and push to maven repo (repo will have to be finalized separately)
sh dev/release/01-perform.sh
# create the source release
sh dev/release/02-source.sh 0.1.0 0

useful commands:
- to set the mvn version in the poms
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.1-SNAPSHOT
- reset your workspace
git reset --hard
- setup gpg agent
eval $(gpg-agent --daemon --allow-preset-passphrase)
gpg --use-agent -s LICENSE.txt 
- delete tag localy
git tag -d apache-arrow-0.1.0
