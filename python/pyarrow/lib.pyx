    Return the number of threads to use in parallel operations.

    The number of threads is determined at startup by inspecting the
    ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` and ``OMP_THREAD_LIMIT`` environment variables.
    If neither is present, it will default to the number of hardware threads
    on the system. It can be modified at runtime by calling
    :func:`set_cpu_count()`.
