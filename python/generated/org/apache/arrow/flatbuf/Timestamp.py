# Timestamp is a 64-bit signed integer representing an elapsed time since a
# fixed epoch, stored in either of four units: seconds, milliseconds,
# microseconds or nanoseconds, and is optionally annotated with a timezone.
#
# Timestamp values do not include any leap seconds (in other words, all
# days are considered 86400 seconds long).
#
# Timestamps with a non-empty timezone
# ------------------------------------
#
# If a Timestamp column has a non-empty timezone value, its epoch is
# 1970-01-01 00:00:00 (January 1st 1970, midnight) in the *UTC* timezone
# (the Unix epoch), regardless of the Timestamp's own timezone.
#
# Therefore, timestamp values with a non-empty timezone correspond to
# physical points in time together with some additional information about
# how the data was obtained and/or how to display it (the timezone).
#
#   For example, the timestamp value 0 with the timezone string "Europe/Paris"
#   corresponds to "January 1st 1970, 00h00" in the UTC timezone, but the
#   application may prefer to display it as "January 1st 1970, 01h00" in
#   the Europe/Paris timezone (which is the same physical point in time).
#
# One consequence is that timestamp values with a non-empty timezone
# can be compared and ordered directly, since they all share the same
# well-known point of reference (the Unix epoch).
#
# Timestamps with an unset / empty timezone
# -----------------------------------------
#
# If a Timestamp column has no timezone value, its epoch is
# 1970-01-01 00:00:00 (January 1st 1970, midnight) in an *unknown* timezone.
#
# Therefore, timestamp values without a timezone cannot be meaningfully
# interpreted as physical points in time, but only as calendar / clock
# indications ("wall clock time") in an unspecified timezone.
#
#   For example, the timestamp value 0 with an empty timezone string
#   corresponds to "January 1st 1970, 00h00" in an unknown timezone: there
#   is not enough information to interpret it as a well-defined physical
#   point in time.
#
# One consequence is that timestamp values without a timezone cannot
# be reliably compared or ordered, since they may have different points of
# reference.  In particular, it is *not* possible to interpret an unset
# or empty timezone as the same as "UTC".
#
# Conversion between timezones
# ----------------------------
#
# If a Timestamp column has a non-empty timezone, changing the timezone
# to a different non-empty value is a metadata-only operation:
# the timestamp values need not change as their point of reference remains
# the same (the Unix epoch).
#
# However, if a Timestamp column has no timezone value, changing it to a
# non-empty value requires to think about the desired semantics.
# One possibility is to assume that the original timestamp values are
# relative to the epoch of the timezone being set; timestamp values should
# then adjusted to the Unix epoch (for example, changing the timezone from
# empty to "Europe/Paris" would require converting the timestamp values
# from "Europe/Paris" to "UTC", which seems counter-intuitive but is
# nevertheless correct).
#
# Guidelines for encoding data from external libraries
# ----------------------------------------------------
#
# Date & time libraries often have multiple different data types for temporal
# data. In order to ease interoperability between different implementations the
# Arrow project has some recommendations for encoding these types into a Timestamp
# column.
#
# An "instant" represents a physical point in time that has no relevant timezone
# (for example, astronomical data). To encode an instant, use a Timestamp with
# the timezone string set to "UTC", and make sure the Timestamp values
# are relative to the UTC epoch (January 1st 1970, midnight).
#
# A "zoned date-time" represents a physical point in time annotated with an
# informative timezone (for example, the timezone in which the data was
# recorded).  To encode a zoned date-time, use a Timestamp with the timezone
# string set to the name of the timezone, and make sure the Timestamp values
# are relative to the UTC epoch (January 1st 1970, midnight).
#
#  (There is some ambiguity between an instant and a zoned date-time with the
#   UTC timezone.  Both of these are stored the same in Arrow.  Typically,
#   this distinction does not matter.  If it does, then an application should
#   use custom metadata or an extension type to distinguish between the two cases.)
#
# An "offset date-time" represents a physical point in time combined with an
# explicit offset from UTC.  To encode an offset date-time, use a Timestamp
# with the timezone string set to the numeric timezone offset string
# (e.g. "+03:00"), and make sure the Timestamp values are relative to
# the UTC epoch (January 1st 1970, midnight).
#
# A "naive date-time" (also called "local date-time" in some libraries)
# represents a wall clock time combined with a calendar date, but with
# no indication of how to map this information to a physical point in time.
# Naive date-times must be handled with care because of this missing
# information, and also because daylight saving time (DST) may make
# some values ambiguous or non-existent. A naive date-time may be
# stored as a struct with Date and Time fields. However, it may also be
# encoded into a Timestamp column with an empty timezone. The timestamp
# values should be computed "as if" the timezone of the date-time values
# was UTC; for example, the naive date-time "January 1st 1970, 00h00" would
# be encoded as timestamp value 0.
