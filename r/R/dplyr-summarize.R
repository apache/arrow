  # summarize() is complicated because you can do a mixture of scalar operations
  # and aggregations, but that's not how Acero works. For example, for us to do
  #   summarize(mean = sum(x) / n())
  # we basically have to translate it into
  #   summarize(..temp0 = sum(x), ..temp1 = n()) %>%
  #   mutate(mean = ..temp0 / ..temp1) %>%
  #   select(-starts_with("..temp"))
  # That is, "first aggregate, then transform the result further."
  #
  # When we do filter() and mutate(), we just turn the user's code into a single
  # Arrow Expression per column. But when we do summarize(), we have to pull out
  # the aggregations, collect them in one list (that will become an Aggregate
  # ExecNode), and in the expressions, replace them with FieldRefs so that
  # further operations can happen (in what will become a ProjectNode that works
  # on the result of the Aggregate).
  # To do this, arrow_mask() includes a list called .aggregations,
  # and the aggregation functions will pull out those terms and insert into
  # that list.
  # nolint end
