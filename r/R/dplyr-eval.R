#' Helpers to raise classed errors
#'
#' `arrow_not_supported()` and `validation_error()` raise classed errors that
#' allow us to distinguish between things that are not supported in Arrow and
#' things that are just invalid input. Additional wrapping in `arrow_eval()`
#' and `try_arrow_dplyr()` provide more context and suggestions.
#' Importantly, if `arrow_not_supported` is raised, then retrying the same code
#' in regular dplyr in R may work. But if `validation_error` is raised, then we
#' shouldn't recommend retrying with regular dplyr because it will fail there
#' too.
#'
#' Use these in function bindings and in the dplyr methods. Inside of function
#' bindings, you don't need to provide the `call` argument, as it will be
#' automatically filled in with the expression that caused the error in
#' `arrow_eval()`. In dplyr methods, you should provide the `call` argument;
#' `rlang::caller_call()` often is correct, but you may need to experiment to
#' find how far up the call stack you need to look.
#'
#' You may provide additional information in the `body` argument, a named
#' character vector. Use `i` for additional information about the error and `>`
#' to indicate potential solutions or workarounds that don't require pulling the
#' data into R. If you have an `arrow_not_supported()` error with a `>`
#' suggestion, when the error is ultimately raised by `try_error_dplyr()`,
#' `Call collect() first to pull data into R` won't be the only suggestion.
#'
#' You can still use `match.arg()` and `assert_that()` for simple input
#' validation inside of the function bindings. `arrow_eval()` will catch their
#' errors and re-raise them as `validation_error`.
#'
#' @param msg The message to show. `arrow_not_supported()` will append
#' "not supported in Arrow" to this message.
#' @param .actual_msg If you don't want to append "not supported in Arrow" to
#' the message, you can provide the full message here.
#' @param ... Additional arguments to pass to `rlang::abort()`. Useful arguments
#' include `call` to provide the call or expression that caused the error, and
#' `body` to provide additional context about the error.
