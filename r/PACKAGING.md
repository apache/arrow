# Packaging Checklist for CRAN Release

For a high-level overview of the Arrow release process see the [Apache Arrow Release Management Guide](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/developers/release.html#post-release-tasks).

## Before the Arrow Release Candidate Is Created

- [ ] [Create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/new/) entitled `[R] CRAN packaging checklist for version X.Y.Z` and copy this checklist to the issue.
- [ ] Review deprecated functions to advance their deprecation status, including removing preprocessor directives that no longer apply (search for `ARROW_VERSION_MAJOR` in r/src).
- [ ] Evaluate the status of any failing [nightly tests and nightly packaging builds](http://crossbow.voltrondata.com). These checks replicate most of the checks that CRAN runs, so we need them all to be passing or to understand that the failures may (though won't necessarily) result in a rejection from CRAN.
- [ ] Check [current CRAN check results](https://cran.rstudio.org/web/checks/check_results_arrow.html).
- [ ] Ensure the contents of the README are accurate and up to date.
- [ ] Run `urlchecker::url_check()` on the R directory at the release candidate.
  commit. Ignore any errors with badges as they will be removed in the CRAN release branch.
- [ ] [Polish NEWS](https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html#news-release) but do **not** update version numbers (this is done automatically later). You can find commits by, for example, `git log --oneline <sha of last release>..HEAD | grep "\[R\]"`.
- [ ] For major releases, prepare content for social media highlighting new features.

_Wait for the release candidate to be created._

## After the Arrow Release Candidate Has Been Created

- [ ] Create a CRAN-release branch from the release candidate commit, name the new branch `maint-X.Y.Z-r` and push to upstream.

## Prepare and Check Package That Will Be Released to CRAN

- [ ] `git fetch upstream && git checkout maint-X.Y.Z-r && git clean -f -d`.
- [ ] Run `make build`. This copies Arrow C++ into tools/cpp, prunes some unnecessary components, and runs `R CMD build` to generate the source tarball. Because this will install the package, you will need to ensure that the version of Arrow C++ available to the configure script is the same as the version that is vendored into the R package (e.g., you may need to unset `ARROW_HOME`).
- [ ] `devtools::check_built("arrow_X.Y.Z.tar.gz")` locally.

## Wait for Arrow Release Vote

- [ ] Release vote passed

## Generate R Package to Submit to CRAN

- [ ] If the release candidate commit updated, rebase the CRAN release branch on that commit.
- [ ] Pick any commits that were made to main since the release commit that were needed to fix CRAN-related submission issues identified in the above steps.
- [ ] Remove badges from README.md.
- [ ] Run `urlchecker::url_check()` on the R directory.
- [ ] Create a PR entitled `WIP: [R] Verify CRAN release-X.Y.Z-rcX`. Add a comment `@github-actions crossbow submit --group r` to run all R crossbow jobs against the CRAN-specific release branch.
- [ ] Run `Rscript tools/update-checksums.R <libarrow version>` to download the checksums for the pre-compiled binaries from the ASF artifactory into the tools directory.
- [ ] Regenerate arrow_X.Y.Z.tar.gz (i.e., `make build`).

## Check Binary Arrow C++ Distributions Specific to the R Package

- [ ] Upload the .tar.gz to [win-builder](https://win-builder.r-project.org/upload.aspx) (r-devel only) and confirm with Jon (who will automatically receive an email about the results) that the check is clean.
- [ ] Upload the .tar.gz to [macOS Builder](https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/submit.html) and confirm that the check is clean.
- [ ] Check `install.packages("arrow_X.Y.Z.tar.gz")` on Ubuntu and ensure that the hosted binaries are used.
- [ ] `devtools::check_built("arrow_X.Y.Z.tar.gz")` locally one more time (for luck).

## Submit Package to CRAN

_This step must be done by the current package maintainer._

- [ ] Upload arrow_X.Y.Z.tar.gz to the [CRAN submit page](https://xmpalantir.wu.ac.at/cransubmit/).
- [ ] Confirm the submission email.

## Wait for CRAN to Accept the Submission

- [ ] CRAN has accepted the submission.
- [ ] Tag the tip of the CRAN-specific release branch with `r-universe-release`.
- [ ] Add a new line to the matrix in the [backwards compatability job](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/main/dev/tasks/r/github.linux.arrow.version.back.compat.yml).
- [ ] (patch releases only) Update the package version in `ci/scripts/PKGBUILD`, `r/DESCRIPTION`, and `r/NEWS.md`.
- [ ] (CRAN-only releases) Rebuild news page with `pkgdown::build_news()` and submit a PR to the asf-site branch of the docs site with the contents of `arrow/r/docs/news/index.html` replacing the current contents of `arrow-site/docs/r/news/index.html`.
- [ ] (CRAN-only releases) Bump the version number in `r/pkgdown/assets/versions.json`, and update this on the [the `asf-site` branch of the docs site](https://github.com/apache/arrow-site) too..
- [ ] Review the packaging checklist template and update as needed.
- [ ] Wait for CRAN-hosted binaries on the [CRAN package page](https://cran.r-project.org/package=arrow) to reflect the new version.
- [ ] Post already-prepared content to social media.
  - Use Bryce's [script](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/amoeba/4e26c064d1a0d0227cd8c2260cf0072a/raw/bc0d983152bdde4820de9074d4caee9986624bc5/new_contributors.R) for contributor calculation.
