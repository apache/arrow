# This script makes sure we have our C++ dependencies in order
# so that we can compile the bindings in src/ and build the
# R package's shared library.
#
# The core logic is:
#
# * Find libarrow on the system. If it is present, make sure
#   that its version is compatible with the R package.
# * If no suitable libarrow is found, download it (where allowed)
#   or build it from source.
# * Determine what features this libarrow has and what other
#   flags it requires, and set them in src/Makevars for use when
#   compiling the bindings.
# * Run a test program to confirm that arrow headers are found
#
# It is intended to be flexible enough to account for several
# workflows, and should be expected to always result in a successful
# build as long as you haven't set environment variables that
# would limit its options.
#
# * Installing a released version from source, as from CRAN, with
#   no other prior setup
#   * On macOS, autobrew is used to retrieve libarrow and dependencies
#   * On Linux, the nixlibs.R build script will download or build
# * Installing a released version but first installing libarrow.
#   It will use pkg-config and brew to search for libraries.
# * Installing a development version from source as a user.
#   Any libarrow found on the system corresponding to a release will not match
#   the dev version and will thus be skipped. nixlibs.R will be used to build libarrow.
# * TODO(GH-35049): Installing a dev version as an infrequent contributor.
#   Currently the configure script doesn't offer much to make this easy.
#   If you expect to rebuild multiple times, you should set up a dev
#   environment.
# * Installing a dev version as a regular developer. 
#   The best way is to maintain your own cmake build and install it
#   to a directory (not system) that you set as the env var
#   $ARROW_HOME.  
#
# For more information, see the various installation and developer vignettes.
