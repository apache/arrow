## Overview

The R `{arrow}` package provides access to many of the features of the [Apache Arrow C++ library](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/index.html) for R users. The goal of arrow is to provide an Arrow C++ backend to `{dplyr}`, and access to the Arrow C++ library through familiar base R and tidyverse functions, or `{R6}` classes.

To learn more about the Apache Arrow project, see the parent documentation of the [Arrow Project](https://arrow.apache.org/). The Arrow project provides functionality for a wide range of data analysis tasks to store, process and move data fast. See the [read/write article](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/read_write.html) to learn about reading and writing data files, [data wrangling](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/data_wrangling.html) to learn how to use dplyr syntax with arrow objects, and the [function documentation](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/acero.html) for a full list of supported functions within dplyr queries.

## Installation

The latest release of arrow can be installed from CRAN. In most cases installing the latest release should work without requiring any additional system dependencies, especially if you are using
Windows or macOS.

```r
install.packages("arrow")
```

Alternatively, if you are using conda you can install arrow from conda-forge:

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge --strict-channel-priority r-arrow
```

There are some special cases to note:

- On macOS, the R you use with Arrow should match the architecture of the machine you are using. If you're using an ARM (aka M1, M2, etc.) processor use R compiled for arm64. If you're using an Intel based mac, use R compiled for x86. Using R and Arrow compiled for Intel based macs on an ARM based mac will result in segfaults and crashes.

- On Linux the installation process can sometimes be more involved because CRAN does not host binaries for Linux. For more information please see the [installation guide](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/install.html).

- If you are compiling arrow from source, please note that as of version 10.0.0, arrow requires C++17 to build. This has implications on Windows and CentOS 7. For Windows users it means you need to be running an R version of 4.0 or later. On CentOS 7, it means you need to install a newer compiler than the default system compiler gcc. See the [installation details article](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/developers/install_details.html) for guidance.

- Development versions of arrow are released nightly. For information on how to installl nightly builds please see the [installing nightly builds](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/install_nightly.html) article.

## What can the arrow package do?

The Arrow C++ library is comprised of different parts, each of which serves a specific purpose. The arrow package provides binding to the C++ functionality for a wide range of data analysis
tasks.

It allows users to read and write data in a variety formats:

- Read and write Parquet files, an efficient and widely used columnar format
- Read and write Arrow (formerly known as Feather) files, a format optimized for speed and
  interoperability
- Read and write CSV files with excellent speed and efficiency
- Read and write multi-file and larger-than-memory datasets
- Read JSON files

It provides access to remote filesystems and servers:

- Read and write files in Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage buckets
- Connect to Arrow Flight servers to transport large datasets over networks

Additional features include:

- Manipulate and analyze Arrow data with dplyr verbs
- Zero-copy data sharing between R and Python
- Fine control over column types to work seamlessly with databases and data warehouses
- Toolkit for building connectors to other applications and services that use Arrow

## What is Apache Arrow?

Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory and
larger-than-memory data. It specifies a standardized language-independent
columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient
analytic operations on modern hardware. It also provides computational libraries
and zero-copy streaming, messaging, and interprocess communication.

This package exposes an interface to the Arrow C++ library, enabling access to
many of its features in R. It provides low-level access to the Arrow C++ library
API and higher-level access through a dplyr backend and familiar R functions.
