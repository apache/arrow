# Getting Involved

Even if you do not plan to contribute to Apache Arrow itself or Arrow
integrations in other projects, we'd be happy to have you involved:

* Join the mailing list: send an email to [dev-subscribe@arrow.apache.org][1].
  Share your ideas and use cases for the project
* Follow our activity on [GitHub issues][3]
* [Learn the format][2]
* Contribute code to one of the reference implementations

We prefer to receive contributions in the form of GitHub pull requests.
Please send pull requests against the [github.com/apache/arrow][4] repository.

If you are looking for some ideas on what to contribute, check out the [GitHub
issues][3] for the Apache Arrow project. Comment on the issue and/or contact
[dev@arrow.apache.org](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/arrow-dev/)
with your questions and ideas.

If you’d like to report a bug but don’t have time to fix it, you can still post
it on GitHub issues, or email the mailing list
[dev@arrow.apache.org](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/arrow-dev/)

# The package.json scripts

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install dependencies and run scrips.

* `yarn clean` - cleans targets
* `yarn build` - cleans and compiles all targets
* `yarn test` - executes tests against built targets

These scripts accept argument lists of targets × modules:

* Available `targets` are `es5`, `es2015`, `esnext`, `ts`, and `all` (default: `all`)
* Available `modules` are `cjs`, `esm`, `umd`, and `all` (default: `all`)

Examples:

* `yarn build` -- builds all ES targets in all module formats
* `yarn build -t es5 -m all` -- builds the ES5 target in all module formats
* `yarn build -t all -m cjs` -- builds all ES targets in the CommonJS module format
* `yarn build -t es5 -t es2015 -m all` -- builds the ES5 and ES2015 targets in all module formats
* `yarn build -t es5 -m cjs -m esm` -- builds the ES5 target in CommonJS and ESModules module formats

This argument configuration also applies to `clean` and `test` scripts.

To run tests on the bundles, you need to build them first.
To run tests directly on the sources without bundling, use the `src` target (e.g. `yarn test -t src`).

* `yarn doc`

Compiles the documentation with [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org/). Use `yarn doc --watch` to automatically rebuild when the docs change.

# Running the Performance Benchmarks

You can run the benchmarks with `yarn perf`. To print the results to stderr as JSON, add the `--json` flag (e.g. `yarn perf --json 2> perf.json`).

You can change the target you want to test by changing the imports in `perf/index.ts`. Note that you need to compile the bundles with `yarn build` before you can import them.

# Testing Bundling

The bundles use `apache-arrow` so make sure to build it with `yarn build -t apache-arrow`. To bundle with a variety of bundlers, run `yarn test:bundle` or `yarn gulp bundle`.

Run `yarn gulp bundle:webpack:analyze` to open [Webpack Bundle Analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer).

# Updating the Arrow format flatbuffers generated code

1. Once generated, the flatbuffers format code needs to be adjusted for our build scripts (assumes `gnu-sed`):

    ```shell
    cd $ARROW_HOME

    # Create a tmpdir to store modified flatbuffers schemas
    tmp_format_dir=$(mktemp -d)
    cp ./format/*.fbs $tmp_format_dir

    # Remove namespaces from the flatbuffers schemas
    sed -i '+s+namespace org.apache.arrow.flatbuf;++ig' $tmp_format_dir/*.fbs
    sed -i '+s+org.apache.arrow.flatbuf.++ig' $tmp_format_dir/*.fbs

    # Generate TS source from the modified Arrow flatbuffers schemas
    flatc --ts -o ./js/src/fb $tmp_format_dir/{File,Schema,Message,Tensor,SparseTensor}.fbs

    # Remove the tmpdir
    rm -rf $tmp_format_dir
    ```

2. Manually fix the unused imports and add // @ts-ignore for other errors

3. Add `.js` to the imports. In VSCode, you can search for `^(import [^';]* from '(\./|(\.\./)+)[^';.]*)';` and replace with `$1.js';`.

4. Execute `yarn lint` from the `js` directory to fix the linting errors
