    <description>Apache Arrow defines a language-independent columnar memory format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware like CPUs and GPUs. The Arrow memory format also supports zero-copy reads for lightning-fast data access without serialization overhead.

Arrow's libraries implement the format and provide building blocks for a range of use cases, including high performance analytics. Many popular projects use Arrow to ship columnar data efficiently or as the basis for analytic engines.

Libraries are available for C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Julia, MATLAB, Python, R, Ruby, and Rust. 

Apache Arrow is software created by and for the developer community. We are dedicated to open, kind communication and consensus decision making. Our committers come from a range of organizations and backgrounds, and we welcome all to participate with us.</description>
