# NOTE: To build this Dockerfile, you probably need to do the following two
# things:
#
# 1. Increase your container image size to a higher value.
#
#  e.g.,
#
#    Set a custom 'storage-opts' value in your Windows Docker config and restart
#    Docker:
#
#        "storage-opts": [
#             "size=50GB"
#        ]
#
#    See
#
#       https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/container-storage#example
#
#    for details on this step and
#
#       https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/build-tools-container?view=vs-2022#troubleshoot-build-tools-containers
#
#    for more information.
#
# 2. Increase the memory limit for the build container to at least 4GB.
#
#  e.g.,
#
#     docker build -t sometag -m 4GB --file `
#       .\ci\docker\python-wheel-windows-vs2022-base.dockerfile .

# NOTE: You must update PYTHON_WHEEL_WINDOWS_IMAGE_REVISION in .env
# when you update this file.
