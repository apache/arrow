## 🚨 AI Policy & Operations

Extracted from CONTRIBUTING.md - operational constraints and procedures.

### AI Policy

- We conventionally prefix the issue title with the component
- Ensure no validity bitmap in UnionArray::SetData"). Respecting this convention

### Key Requirements

- Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
- affect documentation, you do not need to open up a GitHub issue. Instead you can

### Development Procedures

- like to work on it, and a committer or collaborator will assign it to you.
- Any functionality change should have a GitHub issue opened. For minor changes that

### Known Workarounds & Caveats

- specific language governing permissions and limitations



## 🏗️ Architecture & Context Guide

This section provides architectural context and agent-understanding for the codebase.

### Prerequisites

- **Cpp:** 3.9+ (or applicable language version)
- **Package Manager:** pip or uv
- **Test Runner:** pytest

### Architecture Overview

#### Key Components
- **Main Entry:** server.py
- **Test Suite:** 1330 test files
- **Build Configuration:** pyproject.toml, Makefile, Makefile

#### Design Principles

1. **Modularity** - Code organized by functionality with clear separation of concerns
2. **Testability** - Comprehensive test coverage across critical paths
3. **Clarity** - Explicit naming and structure for AI agent understanding
4. **Consistency** - Uniform patterns and conventions throughout codebase
5. **Maintainability** - Well-documented code with clear intent

### Development Workflow

#### Initial Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/arrow.git
cd arrow
pip install -e .
# or
uv sync --all-groups
```

#### Development Commands

**Running Tests:**
```bash
pytest                    # Run all tests
pytest tests/             # Run specific test directory
pytest -v                 # Verbose output with test names
pytest -x                 # Stop on first failure
coverage run -m pytest && coverage report  # With coverage report
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
ruff check .              # Lint with ruff
ruff format .             # Format code
mypy .                    # Type checking (if configured)
```

### Code Style & Conventions

- **Naming:** Use Cpp conventions (snake_case for functions, PascalCase for classes)
- **Type Hints:** Yes (strongly encouraged)
- **Error Handling:** Yes - handle errors at boundaries; let exceptions propagate when another layer owns recovery
- **Logging:** Yes
- **Testing:** Yes - write tests alongside code changes

### Testing Strategy

**Framework:** pytest
**Test Files:** 1330 found

Before committing:
1. Run the full test suite: `pytest`
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Check type hints: `mypy .`
4. Format code: `ruff format .`

### Writing Documentation

When updating docs:
1. Always include explanatory text before code snippets
2. Describe *why* and *what* before showing *how*
3. Keep sections focused on a single concept
4. Use clear, concrete examples

### Contributing Guidelines

This project has a detailed contribution guide at **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**.

**Key Requirements:**
- Review the contribution guide for all requirements
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Ensure alignment with project's contribution policies

### Common Patterns

When contributing to this project:
1. Read existing code in the area you're modifying
2. Follow the established patterns and style
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
5. Add docstrings for public APIs
6. Update tests when changing behavior

### What We Value

✅ Well-tested code with clear intent
✅ Consistent code style and naming conventions
✅ Code that is easy for AI agents to understand
✅ Clear, descriptive commit messages
✅ Modular, reusable components
✅ Comprehensive documentation

### What We Avoid

❌ Large functions doing multiple things
❌ Commented-out dead code
❌ Inconsistent naming or patterns
❌ Unclear error messages
❌ Unexplained magic numbers or strings
❌ Skipped tests or test TODOs

### AI Readiness Dimensions (Scoring)

This project is evaluated across 8 dimensions:

1. **Architecture** (15/100) - Code organization and modularity
2. **Testing** (15/100) - Test coverage and quality
3. **Dependencies** (12/100) - Dependency management
4. **Conventions** (10/100) - Consistent patterns
5. **Entry Points** (7/100) - Clear main/start locations
6. **Security** (15/100) - Input validation and error handling
7. **Build** (10/100) - Clear build/setup instructions
8. **Documentation** (8/100) - Code and project documentation

### Next Steps

Before making changes:
1. Read relevant source files to understand the existing code
2. Look at existing tests for similar functionality
3. Follow the patterns you see in the codebase
4. Write tests for your changes
5. Run `pytest` to verify nothing breaks
6. Run code quality checks: `ruff check . && mypy .`
7. Format your code: `ruff format .`
