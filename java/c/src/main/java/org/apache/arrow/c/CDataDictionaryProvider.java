/**
 * A DictionaryProvider that is used in C Data Interface for imports.
 *
 * <p>CDataDictionaryProvider is similar to {@link DictionaryProvider.MapDictionaryProvider} with a
 * key difference that the dictionaries are owned by the provider so it must eventually be closed.
 *
 * <p>The typical usage is to create the CDataDictionaryProvider and pass it to {@link
 * Data#importField} or {@link Data#importSchema} to allocate empty dictionaries based on the
 * information in {@link ArrowSchema}. Then you can re-use the same dictionary provider in any
 * function that imports an {@link ArrowArray} that has the same schema.
