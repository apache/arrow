function verify(testCase, actualDisplay, expectedDisplay)
    % When the MATLAB GUI is running, 'Ã—' (char(215)) is used as
    % the delimiter between dimension values. However, when the 
    % GUI is not running, 'x' (char(120)) is used as the delimiter.
    % To account for this discrepancy, check if actualDisplay 
    % contains char(215). If not, replace all instances of
    % char(215) in expectedDisplay with char(120).

    tf = contains(actualDisplay, char(215));
    if ~tf
        idx = strfind(expectedDisplay, char(215));
        expectedDisplay(idx) = char(120);
    end
    testCase.verifyEqual(actualDisplay, expectedDisplay);
end
