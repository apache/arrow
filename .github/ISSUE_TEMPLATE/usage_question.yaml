        While we enable issues as a mechanism for new contributors and passers-by who are unfamiliar with Apache Software Foundation projects to ask questions and interact with the project, we encourage users to ask such questions on public mailing lists:
        
        * Development discussions: dev@arrow.apache.org (first subscribe by sending an e-mail to dev-subscribe@arrow.apache.org).

        * User discussions: user@arrow.apache.org (first subscribe by sending an e-mail to user-subscribe@arrow.apache.org).
        
        Do not be surprised by responses to issues raised here directing you to those mailing lists, or to report a bug or feature request here.

        Thank you!
