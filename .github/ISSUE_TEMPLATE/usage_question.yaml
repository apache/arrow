        While we enable issues as a mechanism for new contributors and passers-by who 
        are unfamiliar with Apache Software Foundation projects to ask questions and 
        interact with the project, we encourage users to ask such questions on public 
        mailing lists:
        
        * Development discussions: dev@arrow.apache.org (first subscribe by sending an 
        e-mail to dev-subscribe@arrow.apache.org).
        
        * User discussions: user@arrow.apache.org (first subscribe by sending an e-mail 
        to user-subscribe@arrow.apache.org).
        
        * Mailing list archives: https://arrow.apache.org/community/
        
        
        Do not be surprised by responses to issues raised here directing you to those 
        mailing lists, or to report a bug or feature request here.


        Thank you!
