Thanks for opening a pull request!

If this is not a [minor PR](https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#Minor-Fixes). Could you open an issue for this pull request on GitHub? https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/new/choose

Opening GitHub issues ahead of time contributes to the [Openness](http://theapacheway.com/open/#:~:text=Openness%20allows%20new%20users%20the,must%20happen%20in%20the%20open.) of the Apache Arrow project.

Then could you also rename the pull request title in the following format?

    GH-${GITHUB_ISSUE_ID}: [${COMPONENT}] ${SUMMARY}

or

    MINOR: [${COMPONENT}] ${SUMMARY}

In the case of PARQUET issues on JIRA the title also supports:

    PARQUET-${JIRA_ISSUE_ID}: [${COMPONENT}] ${SUMMARY}
