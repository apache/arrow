## Contributing to Apache Arrow

There are many ways to contribute to Apache Arrow:

* Contributing code (we call them "patches")
* Writing documentation (another form of code, in a way)
* Participating in discussions on GitHub issues or the mailing list
* Helping users of the libraries

## Reporting bugs and asking questions

We use GitHub issues for questions, maintaining a queue of development
work, and as the public record for work on the project. Feel free to
open issues for discussions, bugs, and feature requests. Questions may
also be asked on the user mailing list
[user@arrow.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?user@arrow.apache.org).

## How to contribute patches

We prefer to receive contributions in the form of GitHub pull requests. Please
send pull requests against the [github.com/apache/arrow][4] repository following
the procedure below.

If you are looking for some ideas on what to contribute, check out the [GitHub
issues][3] for the Apache Arrow project. Comment on the issue and/or contact
[dev@arrow.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@arrow.apache.org)
with your questions and ideas.

If you’d like to report a bug but don’t have time to fix it, you can still post
it on JIRA, or email the mailing list
[dev@arrow.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@arrow.apache.org)

To contribute a patch:

1. Break your work into small, single-purpose patches if possible. It’s much
harder to merge in a large change with a lot of disjoint features.
2. If one doesn't already exist, create a GitHub issue for your patch on the [Arrow Project
GitHub](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues).
3. Submit the patch as a GitHub pull request against the main branch. For a
tutorial, see the GitHub guides on [forking a repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)
and [sending a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). So that your pull request syncs with the JIRA issue, prefix your pull request
name with the JIRA issue id (ex: [ARROW-767: [C++] Filesystem abstraction](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/4225))
4. Make sure that your code passes the unit tests. You can find instructions
how to run the unit tests for each Arrow component in its respective README
file.
5. Add new unit tests for your code.

Thank you in advance for your contributions!
