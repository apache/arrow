=======================================
Acero: A C++ streaming execution engine
=======================================

.. warning::

    Acero is experimental and a stable API is not yet guaranteed.

.. note::

    If you are interested in contributing to Acero or learning about its
    internals, please see the :doc:`Acero Developer's Guide<../developers/cpp/acero>`.

For many complex computations, successive direct :ref:`invocation of
compute functions <invoking-compute-functions>` is not feasible
in either memory or computation time. To facilitate arbitrarily large inputs
and more efficient resource usage, the Arrow C++ implementation also
provides Acero, a streaming query engine with which computations can
be formulated and executed.

         and outputs a stream of data.
