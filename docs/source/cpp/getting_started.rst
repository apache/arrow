Getting Started
===============

The following articles demonstrate installation, use, and a basic understanding of Arrow.
These articles will get you setup quickly using Arrow and give you a taste of what the
library is capable of.
Specifically, it contains: an installation and linking guide; documentation of conventions used 
in the codebase and suggested for users; and tutorials, including: 

* Building Arrow arrays and tabular structures 
* Reading and writing Parquet, Arrow, and CSV files
* Executing compute kernels on arrays
* Reading and writing multi-file partitioned datasets

Start here to gain a basic understanding of Arrow, and move on to the :doc:`/cpp/user_guide` to
explore more specific topics and underlying concepts, or the :doc:`/cpp/api` to explore Arrow's 
API.
