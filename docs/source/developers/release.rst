Release Management Guide
========================

This page provides detailed information on the steps followed to perform
a release. It can be used both as a guide to learn the Apache Arrow release
process and as a comprehensive checklist for the Release Manager when
performing a release.

Principles
==========

The Apache Arrow Release follows the guidelines defined at the
`Apache Software Foundation Release Policy <https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html>`_.

Preparing for the release
=========================

Before creating a source release, the Release Manager must ensure that any
resolved JIRAs have the appropriate Fix Version set so that the changelog is
generated properly.

.. dropdown:: Requirements
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :class-title: sd-fs-5
   :class-container: sd-shadow-md

    Some steps of the release require being a committer or a PMC member.

    - Install the :ref:`Archery <archery>` utility which is required for the release.
    - You must not have any arrow-cpp or parquet-cpp environment variables defined except CC or CXX if you want to build with something other than GCC by default (e.g. clang).
    - A GPG key in the Apache Web of Trust to sign artifacts. This will have to be cross signed by other Apache committers/PMC members. If you have multiple GPG keys, you must set the correct GPG key ID in ``~/.gnupg/gpg.conf`` by adding:

    .. code-block::

        default-key ${YOUR_GPG_KEY_ID}

    - The GPG key needs to be added to this `SVN repo <https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/arrow/>`_ and `this one <https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/arrow/>`_.
    - Configure Maven to `publish artifacts to Apache repositories <http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html>`_. You will need to `setup a master password <https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html>`_ at ``~/.m2/settings-security.xml`` and ``settings.xml`` as specified on the `Apache guide <http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html#dev-env>`_. It can be tested with the following command:

    .. code-block::

        # You might need to export GPG_TTY=$(tty) to properly prompt for a passphrase
        mvn clean install -Papache-release

    - Have the build requirements for cpp and c_glib installed.
    - Set the ``CROSSBOW_GITHUB_TOKEN`` environment variable to automatically create the verify release Pull Request.
    - Install ``en_US.UTF-8`` locale. You can confirm available locales by ``locale -a``.
    - Install Python 3 as python
    - Create dev/release/.env from dev/release/.env.example. See the comments in dev/release/.env.example how to set each variable.
    - Setup :ref:`Crossbow<Crossbow>` as defined.
    - Have Docker and docker-compose installed.


Before creating a Release Candidate
===================================

Ensure local tags are removed, gpg-agent is set and JIRA tickets are correctly assigned.

.. code-block::

    # Delete the local tag for RC1 or later
    git tag -d apache-arrow-<version>

    # Setup gpg agent for signing artifacts
    source dev/release/setup-gpg-agent.sh

    # Curate the release
    # The end of the generated report shows the JIRA tickets with wrong version number assigned.
    archery release curate <version>

Ensure a major version milestone for a follow up release is created on GitHub. This will
automatically be used by our merge script as the new version for issues closed when
the maintenance branch is created.

Patch Releases
==============

We usually create patch releases once a major breaking issue has been identified.
Issues that are identified as major breaking issues can be security fixes, broken packages
for specific builds and others.

Any developer can ask for a patch release to be generated sending an email to the
`Arrow development mailing-list <https://arrow.apache.org/community/>`__ with the reason
of why a new release is necessary.
If there is consensus and there is a Release Manager willing to take the effort to create
the release a patch release can be created.

Committers can tag issues that should be included on the next patch release using the
``backport-candidate`` label. Is the responsability of the author or the committer to add the
label to the issue to help the Release Manager identify the issues that should be backported.

If a specific issue is identified as the reason to create a patch release the Release Manager
should validate that, at least, this issue is correctly tagged and included in the patch release.

Be sure to go through on the following checklist:

#. Create milestone
#. Create maintenance branch
#. Include issue that was requested as requiring new patch release
#. Add new milestone to issues with ``backport-candidate`` label
#. cherry-pick issues into maintenance branch

Creating a Release Candidate
============================

These are the different steps that are required to create a Release Candidate.

For the initial Release Candidate on a major release, we will create a maintenance
branch from main.

Follow up Release Candidates will update the maintenance branch by cherry-picking
specific commits.

For the initial Release Candidate for a minor or a patch release we will create
a maintenance branch from the previous corresponding release. For example,
for a 15.0.1 patch we will create a maint-15.0.1 branch from maint-15.0.0 and for
a maint-15.0.2 we will create it from maint-15.0.1. Once the maintenance branch is
created we will update the created maintenance branch by cherry-picking specific
commits.

We have implemented a Feature Freeze policy between Release Candidates.
This means that, in general, we should only add bug fixes between Release Candidates.
In rare cases, critical features can be added between Release Candidates, if
there is community consensus.

Create or update the corresponding maintenance branch
-----------------------------------------------------

.. tab-set::

   .. tab-item:: Initial Release Candidate

      .. code-block::

            # Execute the following from an up to date main branch.
            # This will create a branch locally called maint-X.Y.Z.
            # X.Y.Z corresponds with the Major, Minor and Patch version number
            # of the release respectively. As an example 9.0.0
            archery release --jira-cache /tmp/jiracache cherry-pick X.Y.Z --execute
            # Push the maintenance branch to the remote repository
            git push -u apache maint-X.Y.Z

   .. tab-item:: Follow up Release Candidates

      .. code-block::

            # First run in dry-mode to see which commits will be cherry-picked.
            # If there are commits that we don't want to get applied ensure the version on
            # JIRA is set to the following release.
            archery release --jira-cache /tmp/jiracache cherry-pick X.Y.Z --continue
            # Update the maintenance branch with the previous commits
            archery release --jira-cache /tmp/jiracache cherry-pick X.Y.Z --continue --execute
            # Push the updated maintenance branch to the remote repository
            git push -u apache maint-X.Y.Z

Create the Release Candidate branch from the updated maintenance branch
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

.. code-block::

    # Start from the updated maintenance branch.
    git checkout maint-X.Y.Z

    # The following script will create a branch for the Release Candidate,
    # place the necessary commits updating the version number and then create a git tag
    # on OSX use gnu-sed with homebrew: brew install gnu-sed (and export to $PATH)
    #
    # <rc-number> starts at 0 and increments every time the Release Candidate is burned
    # so for the first RC this would be: dev/release/01-prepare.sh 4.0.0 5.0.0 0
    dev/release/01-prepare.sh <version> <next-version> <rc-number>

    # Push the release tag (for RC1 or later the --force flag is required)
    git push -u apache apache-arrow-<version>
    # Push the release candidate branch in order to trigger verification jobs later
    git push -u apache release-<version>-rc<rc-number>

Build source and binaries and submit them
-----------------------------------------

.. code-block::

    # Build the source release tarball and create Pull Request with verification tasks
    dev/release/02-source.sh <version> <rc-number>

    # Submit binary tasks using crossbow, the command will output the crossbow build id
    dev/release/03-binary-submit.sh <version> <rc-number>

    # Wait for the crossbow jobs to finish
    archery crossbow status <crossbow-build-id>

    # Download the produced binaries
    # This will download packages to a directory called packages/release-<version>-rc<rc-number>
    dev/release/04-binary-download.sh <version> <rc-number>

    # Sign and upload the binaries
    #
    # On macOS the only way I could get this to work was running "echo "UPDATESTARTUPTTY" | gpg-connect-agent" before running this comment
    # otherwise I got errors referencing "ioctl" errors.
    dev/release/05-binary-upload.sh <version> <rc-number>

    # Sign and upload the Java artifacts
    #
    # Note that you need to press the "Close" button manually by Web interface
    # after you complete the script:
    #   https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories
    dev/release/06-java-upload.sh <version> <rc-number>

    # Start verifications for binaries and wheels
    dev/release/07-binary-verify.sh <version> <rc-number>

Verify the Release
------------------

.. code-block::

    # Once the automatic verification has passed start the vote thread
    # on dev@arrow.apache.org. To regenerate the email template use
    SOURCE_DEFAULT=0 SOURCE_VOTE=1 dev/release/02-source.sh <version> <rc-number>

See :ref:`release_verification` for details.

Voting and approval
===================

Start the vote thread on dev@arrow.apache.org and supply instructions for verifying the integrity of the release.
Approval requires a net of 3 +1 votes from PMC members. A release cannot be vetoed.

Post-release tasks
==================

After the release vote, we must undertake many tasks to update source artifacts, binary builds, and the Arrow website.

Be sure to go through on the following checklist:

#. Update the released milestone Date and set to "Closed" on GitHub
#. Make the CPP PARQUET related version as "RELEASED" on JIRA
#. Start the new version on JIRA for the related CPP PARQUET version
#. Merge changes on release branch to maintenance branch for patch releases
#. Add the new release to the Apache Reporter System
#. Upload source
#. Upload binaries
#. Update website
#. Update Homebrew packages
#. Update MSYS2 package

.. dropdown:: Update RubyGems
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :class-title: sd-fs-5
   :class-container: sd-shadow-md

   You need an account on https://rubygems.org/ to release Ruby packages.

   If you have an account on https://rubygems.org/ , you need to join owners of our gems.

   Existing owners can add a new account to the owners of them by the following command line:

   .. code-block:: Bash

      # dev/release/account-ruby.sh raulcd
      dev/release/account-ruby.sh NEW_ACCOUNT

   Update RubyGems after Homebrew packages and MSYS2 packages are updated:

   .. code-block:: Bash

      # dev/release/post-04-ruby.sh 10.0.0
      dev/release/post-04-ruby.sh X.Y.Z

.. dropdown:: Update JavaScript packages
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :class-title: sd-fs-5
   :class-container: sd-shadow-md

   In order to publish the binary build to npm, you will need to get access to the project by asking one of the current collaborators listed at https://www.npmjs.com/package/apache-arrow packages.

   The package upload requires npm and yarn to be installed and 2FA to be configured on your account.

   When you have access, you can publish releases to npm by running the following script:

   .. code-block:: Bash

      # Login to npmjs.com (You need to do this only for the first time)
      npm login --registry=https://registry.yarnpkg.com/

      # dev/release/post-05-js.sh 10.0.0

.. dropdown:: Update C# packages
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :class-title: sd-fs-5
   :class-container: sd-shadow-md

   You need an account on https://www.nuget.org/. You need to join owners of Apache.Arrow package. Existing owners can invite you to the owners at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Apache.Arrow/Manage .

   You need to create an API key at https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys to upload from command line.

   Install the latest .NET Core SDK from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download .

   .. code-block:: Bash

      # NUGET_API_KEY=YOUR_NUGET_API_KEY dev/release/post-06-csharp.sh 10.0.0

.. dropdown:: Upload wheels/sdist to PyPI
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :class-title: sd-fs-5
   :class-container: sd-shadow-md

   pip binary packages (called "wheels") and source package (called "sdist") are built using the crossbow tool that we used above during the release candidate creation process and then uploaded to PyPI (Python Package Index) under the pyarrow package.

   We use the twine tool to upload wheels to PyPI:

   .. code-block:: Bash

      # dev/release/post-09-python.sh 10.0.0
      dev/release/post-09-python.sh <version>

.. dropdown:: Publish Maven packages
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :class-title: sd-fs-5
   :class-container: sd-shadow-md

   - Logon to the Apache repository: https://repository.apache.org/#stagingRepositories
   - Select the Arrow staging repository you created for RC: ``orgapachearrow-XXXX``
   - Click the ``release`` button

.. dropdown:: Update R packages
   :animate: fade-in-slide-down
   :class-title: sd-fs-5
   :class-container: sd-shadow-md

   To publish the R package on CRAN, there are a few steps we need to do first
   in order to ensure that binaries for Windows and macOS are available to CRAN.
   Jeroen Ooms <jeroenooms@gmail.com> maintains several projects that build C++
   dependencies for R packages for macOS and Windows. We test copies of these
   same build scripts in our CI, and at release time, we need to send any
   changes we have and update the versions/hashes upstream.

   When the release candidate is made, make draft pull requests to each
   repository using the rc, updating the version and SHA, as well as any cmake
   build changes from the corresponding files in apache/arrow. Jeroen may
   merge these PRs before the release vote passes, build the binary artifacts,
   and publish them in the right places so that we can do pre-submission checks
   (see below). After the release candidate vote passes, update these PRs
   to point to the official (non-rc) URL and mark them as ready for review.
   Jeroen will merge, build the binary artifacts, and publish them in the
   right places. See the
   `packaging checklist <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/main/r/PACKAGING.md>`_.
   for a precise list of pull requests that must be made prior to submission
   to CRAN.

   Once these binary prerequisites have been satisfied, we can submit to CRAN.
   Given the vagaries of the process, it is best if the R developers on the
   project verify the CRAN-worthiness of the package before submitting.
   Our CI systems give us some coverage for the things that CRAN checks, but
   there are a couple of final tests we should do to confirm that the release
   binaries will work and that everything runs on the same infrastructure that
   CRAN has, which is difficult/impossible to emulate fully with Docker. For a
   precise list of checks, see the
   `packaging checklist <https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/main/r/PACKAGING.md>`_.

   Once all checks are clean, we submit to CRAN, which has a web form for
   uploading packages. The release process requires email confirmation
   from the R package maintainer, currently Neal Richardson.
