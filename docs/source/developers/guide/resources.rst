- GitHub Actions

  GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform.
  Apache Arrow has a set of workflows that run via GitHub Actions to build and test
  every pull request that is opened, merged, etc.

  - `Apache Arrow Actions on GitHub <https://github.com/apache/arrow/actions>`_
  - `Location of the workflows in Arrow: arrow/.github/workflows/ <https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/main/.github/workflows>`_
  - `GitHub Documentation on GitHub Actions <https://docs.github.com/en/actions>`_

- Nightly builds

  It is possible to install the Arrow R package from the nightly builds which are daily development
  builds of the R package and are not the official releases. See more on the
  `Install R package article <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/r/articles/install.html#install-the-nightly-build>`_.
