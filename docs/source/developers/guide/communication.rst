Communication

**About the contributors**

The group of contributors is full of experts, software engineers and core
developers but also full of users, learners and enthusiasts that love doing
what we do and we want to spread this enthusiasm to you also.

We all have silly questions and we all need help lots of times.
We encourage you to be open to communication and we will help as much as
we can.

Due to the scale of the project which includes many languages, everybody
contributing will be faced with new things needed to be learned. Even the most
seasoned C++ developer will need to ask basic questions about R for example.

When communicating, it's important you mark your communication with appropriate
tags ([C++], [R], [Ruby] etc.) so it gets noticed by the right people.

Where to get help 👋
====================

For any question you may have or problems you are facing you can write to 
user or development :ref:`mailing_list` or you can create an issue on
:ref:`github`. Also use GitHub to search through the issues, report bugs
and create feature requests or proposals.

.. _github:

GitHub
~~~~~~

Different options of communicating are provided through GitHub where the project
is hosted. What we use are GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

You can use GitHub issues to:

- **ask questions**,
- **report a bug**,

  .. seealso::

    :ref:`How to make good bug reports and feature requests <bug-reports>`

- **propose a new feature**,
- **propose a bigger change in the documentation**,
- report **a problem with building** one of the Arrow libraries and discuss
  the possible solution (or write to the user mailing list).

  Making an issue about things you are not sure about may feel intimidating,
  but it is also useful for others and the project.

  .. note::
     Make sure to add which operating system and Arrow version you are using
     in the issue description plus the debug information/error.

If you have **a new contribution already written**, you can create a Pull
Request after creating a GitHub issue and mentioning the way you plan to
implement it. It is important to have one of the Arrow developers agree with
your basic proposal for fixing it. Better to ask before you spend too much of
your time on something that we might think is not a good idea.

If you want to **solve an issue that is already in GitHub**, you should
connect with other contributors in the issue comments.

.. _mailing_list:

Mailing Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can subscribe to the **user** or **development** mailing list and browse for
previous topics or ask questions. Whereas discussion on GitHub only notifies people
who are mentioned or are collaborating on a Pull Request, the mailing list allows
you to broadcast to all users or developers. Use these when you want to get feedback
or answers from a wider audience.

There is also a **biweekly developers sync call** that anyone is welcome to join.
It is announced on the development mailing list together with the link to join.

.. seealso::
  More information and links for subscribing to the mailing lists `can be found here <https://arrow.apache.org/community/>`_.
