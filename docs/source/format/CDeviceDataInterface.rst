=================================
The Arrow C Device data interface
=================================

.. warning:: The Arrow C Device Data Interface should be considered experimental

Rationale
=========

The current :ref:`C Data Interface <c-data-interface>`, and most
implementations of it, make the assumption that all data buffers provided
are CPU buffers. Since Apache Arrow is designed to be a universal in-memory
format for representing tabular ("columnar") data, there will be the desire
to leverage this data on non-CPU hardware such as GPUs. One example of such
a case is the `RAPIDS cuDF library`_ which uses the Arrow memory format with
CUDA for NVIDIA GPUs. Since copying data from host to device and back is
expensive, the ideal would be to be able to leave the data on the device
for as long as possible, even when passing it between runtimes and
libraries.

The Arrow C Device data interface builds on the existing C data interface
by adding a very small, stable set of C definitions to it. These definitions
are equivalents to the ``ArrowArray`` and ``ArrowArrayStream`` structures
from the C Data Interface which add members to allow specifying the device
type and pass necessary information to synchronize with the producer.
For non-C/C++ languages and runtimes, translating the C definitions to
corresponding C FFI declarations should be just as simple as with the
current C data interface.

Applications and libraries can then use Arrow schemas and Arrow formatted
memory on non-CPU devices to exchange data just as easily as they do
now with CPU data. This will enable leaving data on those devices longer
and avoiding costly copies back and forth between the host and device
just to leverage new libraries and runtimes.

Goals
-----

* Expose an ABI-stable interface built on the existing C data interface.
* Make it easy for third-party projects to implement support with little
  initial investment.
* Allow zero-copy sharing of Arrow formatted device memory between
  independent runtimes and components running in the same process.
* Avoid the need for one-to-one adaptation layers such as the
  `CUDA Array Interface`_ for Python processes to pass CUDA data.
* Enable integration without explicit dependencies (either at compile-time
  or runtime) on the Arrow software project itself.

The intent is for the Arrow C Device data interface to expand the reach
of the current C data interface, allowing it to also become the standard
low-level building block for columnar processing on devices like GPUs or
FPGAs.

Structure definitions
=====================

Because this is built on the C data interface, the C Device data interface
uses the ``ArrowSchema`` and ``ArrowArray`` structures as defined in the
:ref:`C data interface spec <c-data-interface-struct-defs>`. It then adds the
following free-standing definitions. Like the rest of the Arrow project,
they are available under the Apache License 2.0.

.. code-block:: c

    #ifndef ARROW_C_DEVICE_DATA_INTERFACE
    #define ARROW_C_DEVICE_DATA_INTERFACE

    // Device type for the allocated memory
    typedef int32_t ArrowDeviceType;

    // CPU device, same as using ArrowArray directly
    #define ARROW_DEVICE_CPU 1
    // CUDA GPU Device
    #define ARROW_DEVICE_CUDA 2
    // Pinned CUDA CPU memory by cudaMallocHost
    #define ARROW_DEVICE_CUDA_HOST 3

    #define ARROW_DEVICE_HEXAGON 16

    struct ArrowDeviceArray {
      struct ArrowArray array;
      int64_t device_id;
      ArrowDeviceType device_type;
      void* sync_event;

      // reserved bytes for future expansion
      int64_t reserved[3];
    };

    #endif  // ARROW_C_DEVICE_DATA_INTERFACE

.. note::
   The canonical guard ``ARROW_C_DEVICE_DATA_INTERFACE`` is meant to avoid
   duplicate definitions if two projects copy the definitions in their own
   headers, and a third-party project includes from these two projects. It
   is therefore important that this guard is kept exactly as-is when these
   definitions are copied.

ArrowDeviceType
---------------

The ``ArrowDeviceType`` typedef is used to indicate what type of device the
provided memory buffers were allocated on. This, in conjunction with the
``device_id``, should be sufficient to reference the correct data buffers.

We then use macros to define values for different device types. The provided
macro values are compatible with the widely used `dlpack`_ ``DLDeviceType``
definition values, using the same value for each as the equivalent
``kDL<type>`` enum from ``dlpack.h``. The list will be kept in sync with those
equivalent enum values over time to ensure compatibility, rather than
potentially diverging. To avoid the Arrow project having to be in the
position of vetting new hardware devices, new additions should first be
added to dlpack before we add a corresponding macro here.

To ensure predictability with the ABI, we use macros instead of an ``enum``
so the storage type is not compiler dependent.

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_CPU

    CPU Device, equivalent to just using ``ArrowArray`` directly instead of
    using ``ArrowDeviceArray``.

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_CUDA

    A `CUDA`_ GPU Device. This could represent data allocated either with the
    runtime library (``cudaMalloc``) or the device driver (``cuMemAlloc``).

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_CUDA_HOST

    CPU memory that was pinned and page-locked by CUDA by using
    ``cudaMallocHost`` or ``cuMemAllocHost``.

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_OPENCL

    Data allocated on the device by using the `OpenCL (Open Computing Language)`_
    framework.

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_VULKAN

    Data allocated by the `Vulkan`_ framework and libraries.

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_METAL

    Data on Apple GPU devices using the `Metal`_ framework and libraries.

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_VPI

    Indicates usage of a Verilog simulator buffer.

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_ROCM

    An AMD device using the `ROCm`_ stack.

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_ROCM_HOST

    CPU memory that was pinned and page-locked by ROCm by using ``hipMallocHost``.

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_EXT_DEV

    This value is an escape-hatch for devices to extend which aren't
    currently represented otherwise. Producers would need to provide
    additional information/context specific to the device if using
    this device type. This is used to quickly test extension devices
    and semantics can differ based on the implementation.

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_CUDA_MANAGED

    CUDA managed/unified memory which is allocated by ``cudaMallocManaged``.

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_ONEAPI

    Unified shared memory allocated on an Intel `oneAPI`_ non-partitioned
    device. A call to the ``oneAPI`` runtime is required to determine
    the specific device type, the USM allocation type and the sycl context
    that it is bound to.

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_WEBGPU

    GPU support for next-gen WebGPU standards

.. c:macro:: ARROW_DEVICE_HEXAGON

    Data allocated on a Qualcomm Hexagon DSP device.

The ArrowDeviceArray structure
------------------------------

The ``ArrowDeviceArray`` structure embeds the C data ``ArrowArray`` structure
and adds additional information necessary for consumers to use the data. It
has the following fields:

.. c:member:: struct ArrowArray ArrowDeviceArray.array

    *Mandatory.* The allocated array data. The values in the ``void**`` buffers (along
    with the buffers of any children) are what is allocated on the device.
    The buffer values should be device pointers. The rest of the structure
    should be accessible to the CPU.

    The ``private_data`` and ``release`` callback of this structure should
    contain any necessary information and structures related to freeing
    the array according to the device it is allocated on, rather than
    having a separate release callback and ``private_data`` pointer here.

.. c:member:: int64_t ArrowDeviceArray.device_id

    *Mandatory.* The device id to identify a specific device if multiple devices of this
    type are on the system. The semantics of the id will be hardware dependent,
    but we use an ``int64_t`` to future-proof the id as devices change over time.

    For device types that do not have an intrinsic notion of a device identifier (e.g.,
    ``ARROW_DEVICE_CPU``), it is recommended to use a ``device_id`` of -1 as a
    convention.

.. c:member:: ArrowDeviceType ArrowDeviceArray.device_type

    *Mandatory.* The type of the device which can access the buffers in the array.

.. c:member:: void* ArrowDeviceArray.sync_event

    *Optional.* An event-like object to synchronize on if needed.

    Many devices, like GPUs, are primarily asynchronous with respect to
    CPU processing. As such, in order to safely access device memory, it is often
    necessary to have an object to synchronize processing with. Since
    different devices will use different types to specify this, we use a
    ``void*`` which can be coerced into a pointer to whatever the device
    appropriate type is.

    If synchronization is not needed, this can be null. If this is non-null
    then it MUST be used to call the appropriate sync method for the device
    (e.g. ``cudaStreamWaitEvent`` or ``hipStreamWaitEvent``) before attempting
    to access the memory in the buffers.

    If an event is provided, then the producer MUST ensure that the exported
    data is available on the device before the event is triggered. The
    consumer SHOULD wait on the event before trying to access the exported
    data.

.. seealso::
    The :ref:`synchronization event types <c-device-data-interface-event-types>`
    section below.

.. c:member:: int64_t ArrowDeviceArray.reserved[3]

    As non-CPU development expands, there may be a need to expand this
    structure. In order to do so without potentially breaking ABI changes,
    we reserve 24 bytes at the end of the object. These bytes MUST be zero'd
    out after initialization by the producer in order to ensure safe
    evolution of the ABI in the future.

.. _c-device-data-interface-event-types:

Synchronization event types
---------------------------

The table below lists the expected event types for each device type.
If no event type is supported ("N/A"), then the ``sync_event`` member
should always be null.

Remember that the event *CAN* be null if synchronization is not needed
to access the data.

Notes:

* \(1) Currently unknown if framework has an event type to support.
* \(2) Extension Device has producer defined semantics and thus if
  synchronization is needed for an extension device, the producer
  should document the type.


Semantics
=========

Memory management
-----------------

First and foremost: Out of everything in this interface, it is *only* the
data buffers themselves which reside in device memory (i.e. the ``buffers``
member of the ``ArrowArray`` struct). Everything else should be in CPU
memory.

The ``ArrowDeviceArray`` structure contains an ``ArrowArray`` object which
itself has :ref:`specific semantics <c-data-interface-semantics>` for releasing
memory. The term *"base structure"* below refers to the ``ArrowDeviceArray``
object that is passed directly between the producer and consumer -- not any
child structure thereof.

It is intended for the base structure to be stack- or heap-allocated by the
*consumer*. In this case, the producer API should take a pointer to the
consumer-allocated structure.

However, any data pointed to by the struct MUST be allocated and maintained
by the producer. This includes the ``sync_event`` member if it is not null,
along with any pointers in the ``ArrowArray`` object as usual. Data lifetime
is managed through the ``release`` callback of the ``ArrowArray`` member.

For an ``ArrowDeviceArray``, the semantics of a released structure and the
callback semantics are identical to those for
:ref:`ArrowArray itself <c-data-interface-released>`. Any producer specific context
information necessary for releasing the device data buffers, in addition to
any allocated event, should be stored in the ``private_data`` member of
the ``ArrowArray`` and managed by the ``release`` callback.

Moving an array
'''''''''''''''

The consumer can *move* the ``ArrowDeviceArray`` structure by bitwise copying
or shallow member-wise copying. Then it MUST mark the source structure released
by setting the ``release`` member of the embedded ``ArrowArray`` structure to
``NULL``, but *without* calling that release callback. This ensures that only
one live copy of the struct is active at any given time and that lifetime is
correctly communicated to the producer.

As usual, the release callback will be called on the destination structure
when it is not needed anymore.

Record batches
--------------
As with the C data interface itself, a record batch can be trivially considered
as an equivalent struct array. In this case the metadata of the top-level
``ArrowSchema`` can be used for schema-level metadata of the record batch.

Mutability
----------

Both the producer and the consumer SHOULD consider the exported data (that
is, the data reachable on the device through the ``buffers`` member of
the embedded ``ArrowArray``) to be immutable, as either party could otherwise
see inconsistent data while the other is mutating it.

Synchronization
---------------

If the ``sync_event`` member is non-NULL, the consumer should not attempt
to access or read the data until they have synchronized on that event. If
the ``sync_event`` member is NULL, then it MUST be safe to access the data
without any synchronization necessary on the part of the consumer.

C producer example
====================

Exporting a simple ``int32`` device array
-----------------------------------------

Export a non-nullable ``int32`` type with empty metadata. An example of this
can be seen in the :ref:`C data interface docs directly <c-data-interface-export-int32-schema>`.

To export the data itself, we transfer ownership to the consumer through
the release callback. This example will use CUDA, but the equivalent calls
could be used for any device:

.. code-block:: c

    static void release_int32_device_array(struct ArrowArray* array) {
        assert(array->n_buffers == 2);
        // destroy the event
        cudaEvent_t* ev_ptr = (cudaEvent_t*)(array->private_data);
        cudaError_t status = cudaEventDestroy(*ev_ptr);
        assert(status == cudaSuccess);
        free(ev_ptr);

        // free the buffers and the buffers array
        status = cudaFree(array->buffers[1]);
        assert(status == cudaSuccess);
        free(array->buffers);

        // mark released
        array->release = NULL;
    }

    void export_int32_device_array(void* cudaAllocedPtr,
                                   cudaStream_t stream,
                                   int64_t length,
                                   struct ArrowDeviceArray* array) {
        // get device id
        int device;
        cudaError_t status;
        status = cudaGetDevice(&device);
        assert(status == cudaSuccess);

        cudaEvent_t* ev_ptr = (cudaEvent_t*)malloc(sizeof(cudaEvent_t));
        assert(ev_ptr != NULL);
        status = cudaEventCreate(ev_ptr);
        assert(status == cudaSuccess);

        // record event on the stream, assuming that the passed in
        // stream is where the work to produce the data will be processing.
        status = cudaEventRecord(*ev_ptr, stream);
        assert(status == cudaSuccess);

        memset(array, 0, sizeof(struct ArrowDeviceArray));
        // initialize fields
        *array = (struct ArrowDeviceArray) {
            .array = (struct ArrowArray) {
                .length = length,
                .null_count = 0,
                .offset = 0,
                .n_buffers = 2,
                .n_children = 0,
                .children = NULL,
                .dictionary = NULL,
                // bookkeeping
                .release = &release_int32_device_array,
                // store the event pointer as private data in the array
                // so that we can access it in the release callback.
                .private_data = (void*)(ev_ptr),
            },
            .device_id = (int64_t)(device),
            .device_type = ARROW_DEVICE_CUDA,
            // pass the event pointer to the consumer
            .sync_event = (void*)(ev_ptr),
        };

        // allocate list of buffers
        array->array.buffers = (const void**)malloc(sizeof(void*) * array->array.n_buffers);
        assert(array->array.buffers != NULL);
        array->array.buffers[0] = NULL;
        array->array.buffers[1] = cudaAllocedPtr;
    }

    // calling the release callback should be done using the array member
    // of the device array.
    static void release_device_array_helper(struct ArrowDeviceArray* arr) {
        arr->array.release(&arr->array);
    }

Device Stream Interface
=======================

Like the :ref:`C stream interface <c-stream-interface>`, the C Device data
interface also specifies a higher-level structure for easing communication
of streaming data within a single process.

Semantics
---------

An Arrow C device stream exposes a streaming source of data chunks, each with
the same schema. Chunks are obtained by calling a blocking pull-style iteration
function. It is expected that all chunks should be providing data on the same
device type (but not necessarily the same device id). If it is necessary
to provide a stream of data on multiple device types, a producer should
provide a separate stream object for each device type.

Structure definition
--------------------

The C device stream interface is defined by a single ``struct`` definition:

.. code-block:: c

    #ifndef ARROW_C_DEVICE_STREAM_INTERFACE
    #define ARROW_C_DEVICE_STREAM_INTERFACE

    struct ArrowDeviceArrayStream {
        // device type that all arrays will be accessible from
        ArrowDeviceType device_type;
        // callbacks
        int (*get_schema)(struct ArrowDeviceArrayStream*, struct ArrowSchema*);
        int (*get_next)(struct ArrowDeviceArrayStream*, struct ArrowDeviceArray*);
        const char* (*get_last_error)(struct ArrowDeviceArrayStream*);

        // release callback
        void (*release)(struct ArrowDeviceArrayStream*);

        // opaque producer-specific data
        void* private_data;
    };

    #endif  // ARROW_C_DEVICE_STREAM_INTERFACE

.. note::
    The canonical guard ``ARROW_C_DEVICE_STREAM_INTERFACE`` is meant to avoid
    duplicate definitions if two projects copy the C device stream interface
    definitions into their own headers, and a third-party project includes
    from these two projects. It is therefore important that this guard is
    kept exactly as-is when these definitions are copied.

The ArrowDeviceArrayStream structure
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The ``ArrowDeviceArrayStream`` provides a device type that can access the
resulting data along with the required callbacks to interact with a
streaming source of Arrow arrays. It has the following fields:

.. c:member:: ArrowDeviceType device_type

    *Mandatory.* The device type that this stream produces data on. All
    ``ArrowDeviceArray`` s that are produced by this stream should have the
    same device type as is set here. This is a convenience for the consumer
    to not have to check every array that is retrieved and instead allows
    higher-level coding constructs for streams.

.. c:member:: int (*ArrowDeviceArrayStream.get_schema)(struct ArrowDeviceArrayStream*, struct ArrowSchema* out)

    *Mandatory.* This callback allows the consumer to query the schema of
    the chunks of data in the stream. The schema is the same for all data
    chunks.

    This callback must NOT be called on a released ``ArrowDeviceArrayStream``.

    *Return value:* 0 on success, a non-zero
    :ref:`error code <c-stream-interface-error-codes>` otherwise.

.. c:member:: int (*ArrowDeviceArrayStream.get_next)(struct ArrowDeviceArrayStream*, struct ArrowDeviceArray* out)

    *Mandatory.* This callback allows the consumer to get the next chunk of
    data in the stream.

    This callback must NOT be called on a released ``ArrowDeviceArrayStream``.

    The next chunk of data MUST be accessible from a device type matching the
    :c:member:`ArrowDeviceArrayStream.device_type`.

    *Return value:* 0 on success, a non-zero
    :ref:`error code <c-stream-interface-error-codes>` otherwise.

    On success, the consumer must check whether the ``ArrowDeviceArray``'s
    embedded ``ArrowArray`` is marked :ref:`released <c-data-interface-released>`.
    If the embedded ``ArrowDeviceArray.array`` is released, then the end of the
    stream has been reached. Otherwise, the ``ArrowDeviceArray`` contains a
    valid data chunk.

.. c:member:: const char* (*ArrowDeviceArrayStream.get_last_error)(struct ArrowDeviceArrayStream*)

    *Mandatory.* This callback allows the consumer to get a textual description
    of the last error.

    This callback must ONLY be called if the last operation on the
    ``ArrowDeviceArrayStream`` returned an error. It must NOT be called on a
    released ``ArrowDeviceArrayStream``.

    *Return value:* a pointer to a NULL-terminated character string
    (UTF8-encoded). NULL can also be returned if no detailed description is
    available.

    The returned pointer is only guaranteed to be valid until the next call
    of one of the stream's callbacks. The character string it points to should
    be copied to consumer-managed storage if it is intended to survive longer.

.. c:member:: void (*ArrowDeviceArrayStream.release)(struct ArrowDeviceArrayStream*)

    *Mandatory.* A pointer to a producer-provided release callback.

.. c:member:: void* ArrowDeviceArrayStream.private_data

    *Optional.* An opaque pointer to producer-provided private data.

    Consumers MUST NOT process this member. Lifetime of this member is
    handled by the producer, and especially by the release callback.

Result lifetimes
''''''''''''''''

The data returned by the ``get_schema`` and ``get_next`` callbacks must be
released independently. Their lifetimes are not tied to that of
``ArrowDeviceArrayStream``.

Stream lifetime
'''''''''''''''

Lifetime of the C stream is managed using a release callback with similar
usage as in :ref:`C data interface <c-data-interface-released>`.

Thread safety
'''''''''''''

The stream source is not assumed to be thread-safe. Consumers wanting to
call ``get_next`` from several threads should ensure those calls are
serialized.

Interoperability with other interchange formats
===============================================

Other interchange APIs, such as the `CUDA Array Interface`_, include
members to pass the shape and the data types of the data buffers being
exported. This information is necessary to interpret the raw bytes in the
device data buffers that are being shared. Rather than store the
shape / types of the data alongside the ``ArrowDeviceArray``, users
should utilize the existing ``ArrowSchema`` structure to pass any data
type and shape information.

Updating this specification
===========================

.. note::
    Since this specification is still considered experimental, there is the
    (still very low) possibility it might change slightly. The reason for
    tagging this as "experimental" is because we don't know what we don't know.
    Work and research was done to ensure a generic ABI compatible with many
    different frameworks, but it is always possible something was missed.
    Once this is supported in an official Arrow release and usage is observed
    to confirm there aren't any modifications necessary, the "experimental"
    tag will be removed and the ABI frozen.

Once this specification is supported in an official Arrow release, the C ABI
is frozen. This means that the ``ArrowDeviceArray`` structure definition
should not change in any way -- including adding new members.

Backwards-compatible changes are allowed, for example new macro values for
:c:type:`ArrowDeviceType` or converting the reserved 24 bytes into a
different type/member without changing the size of the structure.

Any incompatible changes should be part of a new specification, for example
``ArrowDeviceArrayV2``.
