========================
Memory and IO Interfaces
========================

This section will introduce you to the major concepts in PyArrow's memory
management and IO systems:

* Buffers
* Memory pools
* File-like and stream-like objects

Referencing and Allocating Memory
=================================

pyarrow.Buffer
--------------

The :class:`Buffer` object wraps the C++ :cpp:class:`arrow::Buffer` type
which is the primary tool for memory management in Apache Arrow in C++. It permits
higher-level array classes to safely interact with memory which they may or may
not own. ``arrow::Buffer`` can be zero-copy sliced to permit Buffers to cheaply
reference other Buffers, while preserving memory lifetime and clean
parent-child relationships.

There are many implementations of ``arrow::Buffer``, but they all provide a
standard interface: a data pointer and length. This is similar to Python's
built-in ``buffer protocol`` and ``memoryview`` objects.

A :class:`Buffer` can be created from any Python object implementing
the buffer protocol by calling the :func:`py_buffer` function. Let's consider
a bytes object:

.. ipython:: python

   import pyarrow as pa

   data = b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
   buf = pa.py_buffer(data)
   buf
   buf.size

Creating a Buffer in this way does not allocate any memory; it is a zero-copy
view on the memory exported from the ``data`` bytes object.

External memory, under the form of a raw pointer and size, can also be
referenced using the :func:`foreign_buffer` function.

Buffers can be used in circumstances where a Python buffer or memoryview is
required, and such conversions are zero-copy:

.. ipython:: python

   memoryview(buf)

The Buffer's :meth:`~Buffer.to_pybytes` method converts the Buffer's data to a
Python bytestring (thus making a copy of the data):

.. ipython:: python

   buf.to_pybytes()

Memory Pools
------------

All memory allocations and deallocations (like ``malloc`` and ``free`` in C)
are tracked in an instance of :class:`MemoryPool`. This means that we can
then precisely track amount of memory that has been allocated:

.. ipython:: python

   pa.total_allocated_bytes()

Let's allocate a resizable :class:`Buffer` from the default pool:

.. ipython:: python

   buf = pa.allocate_buffer(1024, resizable=True)
   pa.total_allocated_bytes()
   buf.resize(2048)
   pa.total_allocated_bytes()

The default allocator requests memory in a minimum increment of 64 bytes. If
the buffer is garbage-collected, all of the memory is freed:

.. ipython:: python

   buf = None
   pa.total_allocated_bytes()

Besides the default built-in memory pool, there may be additional memory pools
to choose (such as `mimalloc <https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc>`_)
from depending on how Arrow was built.  One can get the backend
name for a memory pool::

   >>> pa.default_memory_pool().backend_name
   'jemalloc'

.. seealso::
   :ref:`API documentation for memory pools <api.memory_pool>`.

.. seealso::
   On-GPU buffers using Arrow's optional :doc:`CUDA integration <integration/cuda>`.


Input and Output
================

.. _io.native_file:

The Arrow C++ libraries have several abstract interfaces for different kinds of
IO objects:

* Read-only streams
* Read-only files supporting random access
* Write-only streams
* Write-only files supporting random access
* File supporting reads, writes, and random access

In the interest of making these objects behave more like Python's built-in
``file`` objects, we have defined a :class:`~pyarrow.NativeFile` base class
which implements the same API as regular Python file objects.

:class:`~pyarrow.NativeFile` has some important features which make it
preferable to using Python files with PyArrow where possible:

* Other Arrow classes can access the internal C++ IO objects natively, and do
  not need to acquire the Python GIL
* Native C++ IO may be able to do zero-copy IO, such as with memory maps

There are several kinds of :class:`~pyarrow.NativeFile` options available:

* :class:`~pyarrow.OSFile`, a native file that uses your operating system's
  file descriptors
* :class:`~pyarrow.MemoryMappedFile`, for reading (zero-copy) and writing with
  memory maps
* :class:`~pyarrow.BufferReader`, for reading :class:`~pyarrow.Buffer` objects
  as a file
* :class:`~pyarrow.BufferOutputStream`, for writing data in-memory, producing a
  Buffer at the end
* :class:`~pyarrow.FixedSizeBufferWriter`, for writing data into an already
  allocated Buffer
* :class:`~pyarrow.HdfsFile`, for reading and writing data to the Hadoop Filesystem
* :class:`~pyarrow.PythonFile`, for interfacing with Python file objects in C++
* :class:`~pyarrow.CompressedInputStream` and
  :class:`~pyarrow.CompressedOutputStream`, for on-the-fly compression or
  decompression to/from another stream

There are also high-level APIs to make instantiating common kinds of streams
easier.

High-Level API
--------------

Input Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :func:`~pyarrow.input_stream` function allows creating a readable
:class:`~pyarrow.NativeFile` from various kinds of sources.

* If passed a :class:`~pyarrow.Buffer` or a ``memoryview`` object, a
  :class:`~pyarrow.BufferReader` will be returned:

   .. ipython:: python

      buf = memoryview(b"some data")
      stream = pa.input_stream(buf)
      stream.read(4)

* If passed a string or file path, it will open the given file on disk
  for reading, creating a :class:`~pyarrow.OSFile`.  Optionally, the file
  can be compressed: if its filename ends with a recognized extension
  such as ``.gz``, its contents will automatically be decompressed on
  reading.

  .. ipython:: python

     import gzip
     with gzip.open('example.gz', 'wb') as f:
         f.write(b'some data\n' * 3)

     stream = pa.input_stream('example.gz')
     stream.read()

* If passed a Python file object, it will wrapped in a :class:`PythonFile`
  such that the Arrow C++ libraries can read data from it (at the expense
  of a slight overhead).

Output Streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:func:`~pyarrow.output_stream` is the equivalent function for output streams
and allows creating a writable :class:`~pyarrow.NativeFile`.  It has the same
features as explained above for :func:`~pyarrow.input_stream`, such as being
able to write to buffers or do on-the-fly compression.

.. ipython:: python

   with pa.output_stream('example1.dat') as stream:
       stream.write(b'some data')

   f = open('example1.dat', 'rb')
   f.read()


On-Disk and Memory Mapped Files
-------------------------------

PyArrow includes two ways to interact with data on disk: standard operating
system-level file APIs, and memory-mapped files. In regular Python we can
write:

.. ipython:: python

   with open('example2.dat', 'wb') as f:
       f.write(b'some example data')

Using pyarrow's :class:`~pyarrow.OSFile` class, you can write:

.. ipython:: python

   with pa.OSFile('example3.dat', 'wb') as f:
       f.write(b'some example data')

For reading files, you can use :class:`~pyarrow.OSFile` or
:class:`~pyarrow.MemoryMappedFile`. The difference between these is that
:class:`~pyarrow.OSFile` allocates new memory on each read, like Python file
objects. In reads from memory maps, the library constructs a buffer referencing
the mapped memory without any memory allocation or copying:

.. ipython:: python

   file_obj = pa.OSFile('example2.dat')
   mmap = pa.memory_map('example3.dat')
   file_obj.read(4)
   mmap.read(4)

The ``read`` method implements the standard Python file ``read`` API. To read
into Arrow Buffer objects, use ``read_buffer``:

.. ipython:: python

   mmap.seek(0)
   buf = mmap.read_buffer(4)
   print(buf)
   buf.to_pybytes()

Many tools in PyArrow, particular the Apache Parquet interface and the file and
stream messaging tools, are more efficient when used with these ``NativeFile``
types than with normal Python file objects.

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   buf = mmap = file_obj = None
   !rm example.dat
   !rm example2.dat

In-Memory Reading and Writing
-----------------------------

To assist with serialization and deserialization of in-memory data, we have
file interfaces that can read and write to Arrow Buffers.

.. ipython:: python

   writer = pa.BufferOutputStream()
   writer.write(b'hello, friends')

   buf = writer.getvalue()
   buf
   buf.size
   reader = pa.BufferReader(buf)
   reader.seek(7)
   reader.read(7)

These have similar semantics to Python's built-in ``io.BytesIO``.
