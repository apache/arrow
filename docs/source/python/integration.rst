PyArrow Integrations
********************

Arrow is designed to be both a framework and an interchange format.

Developers can use Arrow to exchange data between various
technologies and languages without incurring in any extra cost of
marshalling/unmarshalling the data. The Arrow bindings and Arrow
native libraries on the various platforms will all understand Arrow data
natively without the need to decode it.

This allows to easily integrate PyArrow with other languages and technologies.
