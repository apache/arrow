Reading JSON files
==================

Arrow supports reading columnar data from line-delimited JSON files.
In this context, a JSON file consists of multiple JSON objects, one per line,
representing individual data rows.  For example, this file represents
two rows of data with four columns "a", "b", "c", "d":

.. code-block:: json

   {"a": 1, "b": 2.0, "c": "foo", "d": false}
   {"a": 4, "b": -5.5, "c": null, "d": true}

The features currently offered are the following:

* multi-threaded or single-threaded reading
* automatic decompression of input files (based on the filename extension,
  such as ``my_data.json.gz``)
* sophisticated type inference (see below)

.. note::
   Currently only the line-delimited JSON format is supported.


Usage
-----

JSON reading functionality is available through the :mod:`pyarrow.json` module.
In many cases, you will simply call the :func:`read_json` function
with the file path you want to read from::

   >>> from pyarrow import json
   >>> fn = 'my_data.json'
   >>> table = json.read_json(fn)
   >>> table
   pyarrow.Table
   a: int64
   b: double
   c: string
   d: bool
   >>> table.to_pandas()
      a    b     c      d
   0  1  2.0   foo  False
   1  4 -5.5  None   True


Automatic Type Inference
------------------------

Arrow :ref:`data types <data.types>` are inferred from the JSON types and
values of each column:

* JSON null values convert to the ``null`` type, but can fall back to any
  other type.
* JSON booleans convert to ``bool_``.
* JSON numbers convert to ``int64``, falling back to ``float64`` if a
  non-integer is encountered.
* JSON strings of the kind "YYYY-MM-DD" and "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss" convert
  to ``timestamp[s]``, falling back to ``utf8`` if a conversion error occurs.
* JSON arrays convert to a ``list`` type, and inference proceeds recursively
  on the JSON arrays' values.
* Nested JSON objects convert to a ``struct`` type, and inference proceeds
  recursively on the JSON objects' values.

Thus, reading this JSON file:

.. code-block:: json

   {"a": [1, 2], "b": {"c": true, "d": "1991-02-03"}}
   {"a": [3, 4, 5], "b": {"c": false, "d": "2019-04-01"}}

returns the following data::

   >>> table = json.read_json("my_data.json")
   >>> table
   pyarrow.Table
   a: list<item: int64>
     child 0, item: int64
   b: struct<c: bool, d: timestamp[s]>
     child 0, c: bool
     child 1, d: timestamp[s]
   >>> table.to_pandas()
              a                                       b
   0     [1, 2]   {'c': True, 'd': 1991-02-03 00:00:00}
   1  [3, 4, 5]  {'c': False, 'd': 2019-04-01 00:00:00}


Customized parsing
------------------

To alter the default parsing settings in case of reading JSON files with an
unusual structure, you should create a :class:`ParseOptions` instance
and pass it to :func:`read_json`.  For example, you can pass an explicit
:ref:`schema <data.schema>` in order to bypass automatic type inference.

Similarly, you can choose performance settings by passing a
:class:`ReadOptions` instance to :func:`read_json`.
