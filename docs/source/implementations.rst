official Arrow libraries.

Cookbook
========

The Apache Arrow Cookbook is a collection of recipes for using the Arrow
libraries for different programming languages.

* `C++ Cookbook <https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook/cpp/>`_
* `Java Cookbook <https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook/java/>`_
* `Python Cookbook <https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook/py/>`_
* `R Cookbook <https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook/r/>`_

The source files for the Cookbook are maintained in the
`Apache Arrow Cookbooks repository <https://github.com/apache/arrow-cookbook>`_.
