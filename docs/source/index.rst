Apache Arrow
============

Apache Arrow is a development platform for in-memory analytics. It contains a
set of technologies that enable big data systems to process and move data
fast. It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory format
for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on
modern hardware.

The project is developing a multi-language collection of libraries for solving
systems problems related to in-memory analytical data processing. This includes
such topics as:

* Zero-copy shared memory and RPC-based data movement
* Reading and writing file formats (like CSV, Apache ORC, and Apache Parquet)
* In-memory analytics and query processing

**To learn how to use Arrow refer to the documentation specific to your
target environment.**
