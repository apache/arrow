# Apache Arrow Documentation

This directory contains source files for building the main project
documentation. This includes the [Arrow columnar format specification][2].

Instructions for building the documentation site are found in
[docs/source/building.rst][1]. The build depends on the API
documentation for some of the project subcomponents.
