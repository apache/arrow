# Contributing to xsimd

First, thanks for being there! Welcome on board, we will try to make your
contributing journey as good an experience as it can be.

# Submitting patches

Patches should be submitted through Github PR. We di put some effort to setup a
decent Continuous Integration coverage, please try to make it green ;-)

We use [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to keep
the coding style consistent, a ``.clang-format`` file is shipped within the
source, feel free to use it!

# Extending the API

We are open to extending the API, as long as it has been discussed either in an
Issue or a PR. The only constraint is to add testing for new functions, and make
sure they work on all supported architectures, not only your favorite one!

# Licensing

We use a shared copyright model that enables all contributors to maintain the
copyright on their contributions. Stated otherwise, there's no copyright
assignment.
