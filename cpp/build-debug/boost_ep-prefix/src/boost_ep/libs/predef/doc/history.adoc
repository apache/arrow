= History

== 1.14.0

* Add detection of LoongArch (from Zhang Na).

== 1.13.1

* Fix spelling of "epoch".
* Add missing parenthesis in `sparc.h` (from tkoecker).
* Update documentation to use Rouge code styling and Amber general style.

== 1.13

* Add `ARCH_PPC_64` predef.
* Fix `ARCH_WORD_BITS*` redefinition warnings/errors.
* Add `ARCH_E2K`, Elbrus 2000, architecture from Konstantin Ivlev.
* Fix not handling recent C++ version that go above 10.x version.

== 1.12

* Switch to using the endian.h header on OpenBSD. (Brad Smith)
* Fix not handling recent versions of stdcxx that go above version 9.
* Fix including sub-BSD OS headers directly causing redef warnings.
* Add CI testing of direct inclusion of all headers.
* Add CI testing on FreeBSD for clang and gcc.
* Add `WORD_BITS` set of predefs to detect the architecture word size.
  Initial implementation inspired by submission from Mikhail Komarov.
* Add CI testing for Cygwin 32 and 64.

== 1.11

* Add `BOOST_ARCH_RISCV`. (from Andreas Schwab)
* Add RISC-V endian detection. (from Thomas Petazzoni)
* Convert documentation to AsciiDoctor format.
* Document correct versions for C++ standard.
* Fix compile error from not available header when building in WinCE.
* Remove deprecated `BOOST_OS_ANDROID`.
* Fix compile for Wine. (Kevin Puetz)

== 1.10

* Fix bad include of sub-BSD os headers from main BSD header.
* Fix use of deprecated `TARGET_IPHONE_SIMULATOR` instead of newer
  `TARGET_OS_SIMULATOR`.
* Add `BOOST_PLAT_ANDROID` to resolve conflict between Linux and Android
  OS predefs. The `BOOST_OS_ANDROID` predef is now deprecated and will be
  removed in a future release.
* Add support for consuming Predef as a CMake project.
* Add support for consuming Predef as a standalone B2 project.

== 1.9

* Fixes for `BOOST_COMP_NVCC*` predefs. (from Benjamin Worpitz)
* Add specific version information for Cygwin OS predef. (from James E. King III)

== 1.8

* Add support for __ARM_ARCH macro. (from Tim Blechmann)
* Add detection for PTX architecture. (from Benjamin Worpitz)
* Add nvcc compiler detection. (from Benjamin Worpitz)
* Add support for detecting CUDA. (from Benjamin Worpitz)
* Remove reference to obsolete BOOST_ARCH_AMD64. (from Peter Kolbus)

== 1.7

* Fix BOOST_ARCH_PARISK/BOOST_ARCH_PARISC typo.
* Improved Windows Universal Platform detection. (from James E. King, III)
* Add detection for CloudABI with cloudlibc. (from James E. King, III)

== 1.6

* Fix Intel C/{CPP} version 9999 detection to be 12.1.0.
* Addition of `BOOST_PREDEF_WORKAROUND` and `BOOST_PREDEF_TESTED_AT` macros
  for defect workarounds and detection.
* Add ARM64 MSVC SIMD detection. (from Minmin Gong)
* Add detection of iOS simulator vs device as a platform choice. (from Ruslan
  Baratov)
* Fix MinGW incorrect header guard. (from Ruslan Baratov)

== 1.5

* Fix Intel C/{CPP} compiler version specification.
* Add `BOOST_VERSION_NUMBER_MAJOR`, `BOOST_VERSION_NUMBER_MINOR`,
  `BOOST_VERSION_NUMBER_PATCH` macros to extract components from valid version
  numbers.
* Change VS version numbering. Version after VS2015 will use the compiler
  version instead of the varied product versions.

== 1.4.1

* Small fixes for some redefinition errors, and mispelled macros.
* Slightly rearrangement of structure to comply with current library requirements.

== 1.4

* Add detection of SIMD hardware. With the addition of the `BOOST_HW_*`
  category (from Charly Chevalier).
* Add compile only version of check utilities to address cross-compile
  use cases. And changed the BBv2 check support to use compile only checks.
* Fix test warnings.
* Fix typos on `AVAILABLE` macros for Windows Platform. (from Vemund Handeland)

== 1.3

* Fix many problems with `predef_check` functionality.
* Update SunPro detection to accommodate latest version of compiler from Oracle.
* Addition of Travis-CI and Appveyor testing.
* Add `and` and `or` logical operators for `predef_check` expression on the Boost Build side.
* Fix `BOOST_ARCH_PARISC` to correctly spelled name (from Graham Hanson).
* Fix `MAKE_YYYYM` macros to correctly limit the month (from rick68).

== 1.2

* Account for skip in Visual Studio product version vs. compiler version.
  This supports version of VS 2015 an onward.
* Add detection of Haiku OS (from Jessica Hamilton).
* Some fixes to endian detection for Android (from mstahl-at-redhat.com).
* Add missing `BOOST_PREDEF_MAKE_0X_VVRRPP` macro (from Erik Lindahl).
* Add `predef_check` program and BBv2 integration for build configuration
  checks.

== 1.1

* Addition of `BOOST_PLAT_*` platform definitions for MinGW and
  Windows platform variants.
* Detection of ARM architecture for Windows compilers to target
  mobile devices of Windows 8.
* Improved ARM detection for 64 bit ARM.
* Added detection of iOS an an operating system.
* Improved detection of endianess on some platforms.
* Addition of exclusive plus emulated definitions for platform
  and compiler detection.

WARNING: The big change for this version is the restructuring of the
definitions to avoid duplicate definitions in one category. That is, only one
`BOOST_OS_*`, `BOOST_COMP_*`, and `BOOST_PLAT_*` variant will be detected
(except for sub-categories).
