# This config sets the following variables in your project::

#   ARROW_FULL_SO_VERSION - full shared library version of the found Arrow
#   ARROW_SO_VERSION - shared library version of the found Arrow
#   ARROW_VERSION - version of the found Arrow
#   ARROW_* - options used when the found Arrow is build such as ARROW_COMPUTE
#   Arrow_FOUND - true if Arrow found on the system
#
# This config sets the following targets in your project::
