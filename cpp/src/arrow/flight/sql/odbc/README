## Steps to Register the 64-bit Apache Arrow ODBC driver on Windows

After the build succeeds, the ODBC DLL will be located in 
`build\debug\Debug` for a debug build and `build\release\Release` for a release build.

1. Open Power Shell as administrator.

2. Register your ODBC DLL:
    Need to replace <path\to\repo> with actual path to repository in the commands.

    i. `cd to repo.`
    ii. `cd <path\to\repo>`
    iii. Run script to register your ODBC DLL as Apache Arrow Flight SQL ODBC Driver
    `.\cpp\src\arrow\flight\sql\odbc\install\install_amd64.cmd <path\to\repo>\cpp\build\< release | debug >\< Release | Debug>\arrow_flight_sql_odbc.dll`
    Example command for reference:
    `.\cpp\src\arrow\flight\sql\odbc\install\install_amd64.cmd C:\path\to\arrow\cpp\build\release\Release\arrow_flight_sql_odbc.dll`

If the registration is successful, then Apache Arrow Flight SQL ODBC Driver 
should show as an available ODBC driver in the x64 ODBC Driver Manager.

## Steps to Generate Windows Installer
1. Build with  `ARROW_FLIGHT_SQL_ODBC=ON` and `ARROW_FLIGHT_SQL_ODBC_INSTALLER=ON`.
2. `cd` to `build` folder.
3. Run `cpack`. 

If the generation is successful, you will find `Apache Arrow Flight SQL ODBC-<version>-win64.msi` generated under the `build` folder.


## Steps to Enable Logging
Arrow Flight SQL ODBC driver uses Arrow's internal logging framework. By default, the log messages are printed to the terminal.
1. Set environment variable `ARROW_ODBC_LOG_LEVEL` to any of the following valid values to enable logging. If `ARROW_ODBC_LOG_LEVEL` is set to a non-empty string that does not match any of the following values, `DEBUG` level is used by default. 

The characters are case-insensitive.
- TRACE
- DEBUG 
- INFO
- WARNING
- ERROR 
- FATAL

The Windows ODBC driver currently does not support writing log files. `ARROW_USE_GLOG` is required to write log files, and `ARROW_USE_GLOG` is disabled on Windows platform since plasma using `glog` is not fully tested on windows.

Note: GH-47670 running more than 1 tests with logging enabled is not fully supported.
