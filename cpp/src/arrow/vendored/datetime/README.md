# Utilities for supporting date time functions

Sources for datetime are adapted from Howard Hinnant's date library
(https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date).

Sources are taken from changeset 1ead6715dec030d340a316c927c877a3c4e5a00c
of the above project.

The following changes are made:
- fix internal inclusion paths (from "date/xxx.h" to simply "xxx.h")
- enclose the `date` namespace inside the `arrow_vendored` namespace
- include a custom "visibility.h" header from "tz.cpp" for proper DLL
  exports on Windows
- disable curl-based database downloading in "tz.h"
