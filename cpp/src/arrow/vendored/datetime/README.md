# Utilities for supporting date time functions

Sources for datetime are adapted from Howard Hinnant's date library
(https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date).

Sources are taken from changeset 5bdb7e6f31fac909c090a46dbd9fea27b6e609a4
of the above project.

The following changes are made:
- fix internal inclusion paths (from "date/xxx.h" to simply "xxx.h")
- enclose the `date` namespace inside the `arrow_vendored` namespace

## How to update

```console
$ cd cpp/src/arrow/vendored/datetime
$ ./update.sh 3.0.3
```
