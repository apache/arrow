# substrait::{ExtensionTypeVariation, ExtensionType}s
# for wrapping types which appear in the arrow type system but
# are not first-class in substrait. These include:
# - null
# - unsigned integers
# - half-precision floating point numbers
# - 32 bit times and dates
# - timestamps with units other than microseconds
# - timestamps with timezones other than UTC
# - 256 bit decimals
# - sparse and dense unions
# - dictionary encoded types
# - durations
# - string and binary with 64 bit offsets
# - list with 64 bit offsets
# - interval<months: i32>
# - interval<days: i32, millis: i32>
# - interval<months: i32, days: i32, nanos: i64>
# - arrow::ExtensionTypes

# FIXME these extension types are not parameterizable, which means among
# other things that we can't declare dictionary type here at all since
# we'd have to declare a different dictionary type for all encoded types
# (but that is an infinite space). Similarly, do we need to declare a
# timestamp variation for all possible timezone strings?
#
# Ultimately these declarations are a promise which needs to be backed by
# equivalent serde in c++. For example, consider u8: when serializing to
# substrait, we need to wrap instances of arrow::uint8 into the type
# variation listed below. It would be ideal if we could SinglePointOfTruth
# this correspondence; either generating c++ from the YAML or YAML from the
# c++.
#
# At present (AFAICT) it's not valid to make this user extensible because
# even if a user adds their custom scalar function to the registry *and*
# defines the mapping from that scalar function to a substrait::ExtensionFunction
# the corresponding YAML doesn't exist at any URI and so it can't be used in
# substrait. Perhaps we could still help that case by providing a tool to
# generate YAML from functions; that'd simplify the lives of people trying to
# write arrow::compute::Functions to "define the function and if you want to
# reference it from substrait generate this YAML and put it at some URI".
#
# In any case for the foreseeable future generation would be far too brittle;
# URIs will not be accessed by anything but humans and the YAML is effectively
# structured documentation. Thus extenders should pass the URI in the same way
# they pass a description string; it's opaque to anything in arrow.
#
# We'll need a global mapping which contains:
#  arrow::uint8 <-> {
#   uri: "https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob//format/substrait/extension_types.yaml",
#   name: "u8"
#  }
#
# And additionally convenient builders for subsets of that mapping during serde:
#  arrow::uint8 <-> reference to anchor
#
# Worth noting: it's valid to have multiple ExtensionFunctions with the same name,
# as long as all impls' mangled ("compound") names are unique.
# Also worth noting: Options may only be enumerations. This will get strange with
# functions like is_in, where we'll have to require that one argument is a literal
# list or something.
