# substrait::{ExtensionTypeVariation, ExtensionType}s
# for wrapping types which appear in the arrow type system but
# are not first-class in substrait. These include:
# - null
# - unsigned integers
# - half-precision floating point numbers
# - 32-bit times and 64-bit dates
# - timestamps with units other than microseconds
# - timestamps with timezones other than UTC
# - 256-bit decimals
# - sparse and dense unions
# - dictionary encoded types
# - durations
# - string and binary with 64 bit offsets
# - list with 64-bit offsets
# - interval<months: i32>
# - interval<days: i32, millis: i32>
# - interval<months: i32, days: i32, nanos: i64>
# - arrow::ExtensionTypes
#
# These types fall into several categories of behavior:

# Certain Arrow data types are, from Substrait's point of view, encodings.
# These include dictionary, the view types (e.g. binary view, list view),
# and REE.
#
# These types are not logically distinct from the type they are encoding.
# Specifically, the types meet the following criteria:
#  *  There is no value in the decoded type that cannot be represented
#     as a value in the encoded type and vice versa.
#  *  Functions have the same meaning when applied to the encoded type
#
# Note: if two types have a different range (e.g. string and large_string) then
# they do not satisfy the above criteria and are not encodings. 
#
# These types will never have a Substrait equivalent.  In the Substrait point
# of view these are execution details.

# The following types are encodings:

# binary_view
# list_view
# dictionary
# ree

# Arrow-cpp's Substrait serde does not yet handle parameterized UDTs.  This means
# the following types are not yet supported but may be supported in the future.
# We define them below in case other implementations support them in the meantime.

# decimal256
# large_list
# fixed_size_list
# duration

# Other types are not encodings, but are not first-class in Substrait.  These
# types are often similar to existing Substrait types but define a different range
# of values.  For example, unsigned integer types are very similar to their integer
# counterparts, but have a different range of values.  These types are defined here
# as extension types.
#
# A full description of the types, along with their specified range, can be found
# in Schema.fbs
#
# Consumers should take care when supporting the below types.  Should Substrait decide
# later to support these types, the consumer will need to make sure to continue supporting
# the extension type names as aliases for proper backwards compatibility.
