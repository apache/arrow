   *
   * The name of the Flight SQL Server.
   * FLIGHT_SQL_SERVER_NAME
   *
   * The native version of the Flight SQL Server.
   * FLIGHT_SQL_SERVER_VERSION
   *
   * The Arrow format version of the Flight SQL Server.
   * FLIGHT_SQL_SERVER_ARROW_VERSION
   *
   * Indicates whether the Flight SQL Server is read only.
   * FLIGHT_SQL_SERVER_READ_ONLY
   *
   * 2. SQL Syntax Information: provides information about SQL syntax supported by the Flight SQL Server.
   *
   * Indicates whether the Flight SQL Server supports CREATE and DROP of catalogs.
   * In a SQL environment, a catalog is a collection of schemas.
   * SQL_DDL_CATALOG
   *
   * Indicates whether the Flight SQL Server supports CREATE and DROP of schemas.
   * In a SQL environment, a catalog is a collection of tables, views, indexes etc.
   * SQL_DDL_SCHEMA
   *
   * Indicates whether the Flight SQL Server supports CREATE and DROP of tables.
   * In a SQL environment, a table is a collection of rows of information. Each row of information
   * may have one or more columns of data.
   * SQL_DDL_TABLE
   *
   * Indicates the case sensitivity of catalog, table and schema names.
   * SQL_IDENTIFIER_CASE
   *
   * Indicates the supported character(s) used to surround a delimited identifier.
   * SQL_IDENTIFIER_QUOTE_CHAR
   *
   * Indicates case sensitivity of quoted identifiers.
   * SQL_QUOTED_IDENTIFIER_CASE
   *
   * If omitted, then all metadata will be retrieved.
